title: No-Regret Learning of Nash Equilibrium for Black-Box Games via Gaussian Processes
abstract: This paper investigates the challenge of learning in black-box games, where
  the underlying utility function is unknown to any of the agents. While there is
  an extensive body of literature on the theoretical analysis of algorithms for computing
  the Nash equilibrium with *complete information* about the game, studies on Nash
  equilibrium in *black-box* games are less common. In this paper, we focus on learning
  the Nash equilibrium when the only available information about an agentâ€™s payoff
  comes in the form of empirical queries. We provide a no-regret learning algorithm
  that utilizes Gaussian processes to identify equilibria in such games. Our approach
  not only ensures a theoretical convergence rate but also demonstrates effectiveness
  across a variety collection of games through experimental validation.
