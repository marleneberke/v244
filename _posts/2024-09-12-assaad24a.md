title: Identifiability of total effects from abstractions of time series causal graphs
abstract: 'We study the problem of identifiability of the total effect of an intervention
  from observational time series only given an abstraction of the causal graph of
  the system. Specifically, we consider two types of abstractions: the extended summary
  causal graph which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between
  lagged and instantaneous relations; and the summary causal graph which does not
  give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total
  effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and we provide necessary
  and sufficient graphical conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs.
  Furthermore, we provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever
  it is identifiable.'
