title: Bayesian Active Learning in the Presence of Nuisance Parameters
abstract: 'In many settings, such as scientific inference, optimization, and transfer
  learning, the learner has a well-defined objective, which can be treated as estimation
  of a target parameter, and no intrinsic interest in characterizing the entire data-generating
  process. Usually, the learner must also contend with additional sources of uncertainty
  or variables — with nuisance parameters. Bayesian active learning, or sequential
  optimal experimental design, can straightforwardly accommodate the presence of nuisance
  parameters, and so is a natural active learning framework for such problems. However,
  the introduction of nuisance parameters can lead to bias in the Bayesian learner’s
  estimate of the target parameters, a phenomenon we refer to as negative interference.
  We characterize the threat of negative interference and how it fundamentally changes
  the nature of the Bayesian active learner’s task. We show that the extent of negative
  interference can be extremely large, and that accurate estimation of the nuisance
  parameters is critical to reducing it. The Bayesian active learner is confronted
  with a dilemma: whether to spend a finite acquisition budget in pursuit of estimation
  of the target or of the nuisance parameters. Our setting encompasses Bayesian transfer
  learning as a special case, and our results shed light on the phenomenon of negative
  transfer between learning environments.'
