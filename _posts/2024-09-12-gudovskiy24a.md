title: 'ContextFlow++: Generalist-Specialist Flow-based Generative Models with Mixed-variable
  Context Encoding'
abstract: Normalizing flow-based generative models have been widely used in applications
  where the exact density estimation is of major importance. Recent research proposes
  numerous methods to improve their expressivity.  However, conditioning on a context
  is largely overlooked area in the bijective flow research. Conventional conditioning
  with the vector concatenation is limited to only a few flow types.  More importantly,
  this approach cannot support a practical setup where a set of context-conditioned
  (*specialist*) models are trained with the fixed pretrained general-knowledge (*generalist*)
  model. We propose ContextFlow++ approach to overcome these limitations using an
  additive conditioning with explicit generalist-specialist knowledge decoupling.
  Furthermore, we support discrete contexts by the proposed mixed-variable architecture
  with context encoders. Particularly, our context encoder for discrete variables
  is a surjective flow from which the context-conditioned continuous variables are
  sampled. Our experiments on rotated MNIST-R, corrupted CIFAR-10C, real-world ATM
  predictive maintenance and SMAP unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks show that
  the proposed ContextFlow++ offers faster stable training and achieves higher performance
  metrics. Our code is publicly available at [github.com/gudovskiy/contextflow](https://github.com/gudovskiy/contextflow).
