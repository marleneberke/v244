title: Efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search via On-the-Fly State-Conditioned Action Abstraction
abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has showcased its efficacy across a broad
  spectrum of decision-making problems. However, its performance often degrades under
  vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple
  sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional
  structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under
  a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary
  network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state,
  which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional
  relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model.
  During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction
  for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration
  of redundant sub-actions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior sample efficiency
  of our method compared to vanilla MuZero, which suffers from expansive action space.
