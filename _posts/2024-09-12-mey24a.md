title: Invariant Causal Prediction with Local Models
abstract: We consider the task of identifying the causal parents of a target variable
  among a set of candidates from observational data. Our main assumption is that the
  candidate variables are observed in different environments which may, under certain
  assumptions, be regarded as interventions on the observed system. We assume a linear
  relationship between target and candidates, which can be different in each environment
  with the only restriction that the causal structure is invariant across environments.
  Within our proposed setting we provide sufficient conditions for identifiability
  of the causal parents and introduce a practical method called L-ICP (<b>L</b>ocalized
  <b>I</b>nvariant <b>Ca</b>usal <b>P</b>rediction), which is based on a hypothesis
  test for parent identification using a ratio of minimum and maximum statistics.
  We then show in a simplified setting that the statistical power of L-ICP converges
  exponentially fast in the sample size, and finally we analyze the behavior of L-ICP
  experimentally in more general settings.
