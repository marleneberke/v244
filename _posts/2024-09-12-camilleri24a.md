title: Fair Active Learning in Low-Data Regimes
abstract: In critical machine learning applications, ensuring fairness is essential
  to avoid perpetuating social inequities. In this work, we address the challenges
  of reducing bias and improving accuracy in data-scarce environments, where the cost
  of collecting labeled data prohibits the use of large, labeled datasets. In such
  settings, active learning promises to maximize marginal accuracy gains of small
  amounts of labeled data. However, existing applications of active learning for fairness
  fail to deliver on this, typically requiring large labeled datasets, or failing
  to ensure the desired fairness tolerance is met on the population distribution.
  To address such limitations, we introduce an innovative active learning framework
  that combines an exploration procedure inspired by posterior sampling with a fair
  classification subroutine. We demonstrate that this framework performs effectively
  in very data-scarce regimes, maximizing accuracy while satisfying fairness constraints
  with high probability. We evaluate our proposed approach using well-established
  real-world benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
  its effectiveness in producing fair models, and improvement over existing methods.
