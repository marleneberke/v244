title: Discrete Probabilistic Inference as Control in Multi-path Environments
abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a discrete and structured distribution
  as a sequential decision problem, where the objective is to find a stochastic policy
  such that objects are sampled at the end of this sequential process proportionally
  to some predefined reward. While we could use maximum entropy Reinforcement Learning
  (MaxEnt RL) to solve this problem for some distributions, it has been shown that
  in general, the distribution over states induced by the optimal policy may be biased
  in cases where there are multiple ways to generate the same object. To address this
  issue, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn a stochastic policy that samples
  objects proportionally to their reward by approximately enforcing a conservation
  of flows across the whole Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we extend
  recent methods correcting the reward in order to guarantee that the marginal distribution
  induced by the optimal MaxEnt RL policy is proportional to the original reward,
  regardless of the structure of the underlying MDP. We also prove that some flow-matching
  objectives found in the GFlowNet literature are in fact equivalent to well-established
  MaxEnt RL algorithms with a corrected reward. Finally, we study empirically the
  performance of multiple MaxEnt RL and GFlowNet algorithms on multiple problems involving
  sampling from discrete distributions.
