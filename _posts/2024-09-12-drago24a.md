title: Bandits with Knapsacks and Predictions
abstract: We study the Bandits with Knapsacks problem with the aim of designing a
  learning-augmented online learning algorithm upholding better regret guarantees
  than the state-of-the-art primal-dual algorithms with worst-case guarantees, under
  both stochastic and adversarial inputs. In the adversarial case, we obtain better
  competitive ratios when the input predictions are accurate, while also maintaining
  worst-case guarantees for imprecise predictions. We introduce two algorithms tailored
  for the full and bandit feedback settings, respectively. Both algorithms integrate
  a static prediction with a worst-case no-$\alpha$-regret algorithm. This yields
  an optimized competitive ratio of $(\pi + (1 -\pi)/\alpha)^{-1}$ in scenarios where
  the prediction is perfect, and a competitive ratio of $\alpha/(1 - \pi)$ in the
  case of highly imprecise predictions, where $\pi \in (0,1)$ is chosen by the learner
  and $\alpha$ is Slaterâ€™s parameter. We complement this analysis by studying the
  stochastic setting under full feedback. We provide an algorithm which guarantees
  a pseudo-regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ with poor predictions, and 0 pseudo-regret
  with perfect predictions. We also characterize the smoothness of the algorithm.
