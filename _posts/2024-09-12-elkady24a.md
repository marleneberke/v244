title: 'Vertical Validation: Evaluating Implicit Generative Models for Graphs on Thin
  Support Regions'
abstract: There has been a growing excitement that implicit graph generative models
  could be used to design or discover new molecules for medicine or material design.
  Because these molecules have not been discovered, they naturally lie in unexplored
  or scarcely supported regions of the distribution of known molecules. However, prior
  evaluation methods for implicit graph generative models have focused on validating
  statistics computed from the thick support (e.g., mean and variance of a graph property).
  Therefore, there is a mismatch between the goal of generating novel graphs and the
  evaluation methods. To address this evaluation gap, we design a novel evaluation
  method called Vertical Validation (VV) that systematically creates thin support
  regions during the train-test splitting procedure and then reweights generated samples
  so that they can be compared to the held-out test data. This procedure can be seen
  as a generalization of the standard train-test procedure except that the splits
  are dependent on sample features. We demonstrate that our method can be used to
  perform model selection if performance on thin support regions is the desired goal.
  As a side benefit, we also show that our approach can better detect overfitting
  as exemplified by memorization.
