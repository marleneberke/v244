title: Distributionally Robust Optimization as a Scalable Framework to Characterize
  Extreme Value Distributions
abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop distributionally robust optimization
  (DRO) estimators, specifically for multidimensional Extreme Value Theory (EVT) statistics.
  EVT supports using semi-parametric models called max-stable distributions built
  from spatial Poisson point processes. While powerful, these models are only asymptotically
  valid for large samples. However, since extreme data is by definition scarce, the
  potential for model misspecification error is inherent to these applications, thus
  DRO estimators are natural. In order to mitigate over-conservative estimates while
  enhancing out-of-sample performance, we study DRO estimators informed by semi-parametric
  max-stable constraints in the space of point processes. We study both tractable
  convex formulations for some problems of interest (e.g. CVaR) and more general neural
  network based estimators. Both approaches are validated using synthetically generated
  data, recovering prescribed characteristics, and verifying the efficacy of the proposed
  techniques. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set of financial
  returns for comparison to a previous analysis. We established the proposed model
  as a novel formulation in the multivariate EVT domain, and innovative with respect
  to performance when compared to relevant alternate proposals.
