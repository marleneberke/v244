title: Bias-aware Boolean Matrix Factorization Using Disentangled Representation Learning
abstract: 'Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) has been widely utilized in fields such
  as recommendation systems, graph learning, text mining, and -omics data analysis.
  Traditional BMF methods decompose a binary matrix into the Boolean product of two
  lower-rank Boolean matrices plus homoscedastic random errors. However, real-world
  binary data typically involves biases arising from heterogeneous row- and column-wise
  signal distributions. Such biases can lead to suboptimal fitting and unexplainable
  predictions if not accounted for. In this study, we reconceptualize the binary data
  generation as the Boolean sum of three components: a binary pattern matrix, a background
  bias matrix influenced by heterogeneous row or column distributions, and random
  flipping errors. We introduce a novel Disentangled Representation Learning for Binary
  matrices (DRLB) method, which employs a dual auto-encoder network to reveal the
  true patterns. DRLB can be seamlessly integrated with existing BMF techniques to
  facilitate bias-aware BMF. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets
  show that DRLB significantly enhances the precision of traditional BMF methods while
  offering high scalability. Moreover, the bias matrix detected by DRLB accurately
  reflects the inherent biases in synthetic data, and the patterns identified in the
  bias-corrected real-world data exhibit enhanced interpretability.'
