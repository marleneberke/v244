title: Performative Reinforcement Learning in Gradually Shifting Environments
abstract: 'When Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are deployed in practice, they
  might impact their environment and change its dynamics. We propose a new framework
  to model this phenomenon, where the current environment depends on the deployed
  policy as well as its previous dynamics. This is a generalization of Performative
  RL (PRL) [Mandal et al., 2023]. Unlike PRL, our framework allows to model scenarios
  where the environment gradually adjusts to a deployed policy. We adapt two algorithms
  from the performative prediction literature to our setting and propose a novel algorithm
  called Mixed Delayed Repeated Retraining (MDRR). We provide conditions under which
  these algorithms converge and compare them using three metrics: number of retrainings,
  approximation guarantee, and number of samples per deployment. MDRR is the first
  algorithm in this setting which combines samples from multiple deployments in its
  training. This makes MDRR particularly suitable for scenarios where the environmentâ€™s
  response strongly depends on its previous dynamics, which are common in practice.
  We experimentally compare the algorithms using a simulation-based testbed and our
  results show that MDRR converges significantly faster than previous approaches.'
