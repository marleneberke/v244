title: Polynomial Semantics of Tractable Probabilistic Circuits
abstract: 'Probabilistic circuits compute multilinear polynomials that represent probability
  distributions. They are tractable models that support efficient marginal inference.
  However, various polynomial semantics have been considered in the literature (e.g.,
  network polynomials, likelihood polynomials, generating functions, Fourier transforms,
  and characteristic polynomials). The relationships between these polynomial encodings
  of distributions is largely unknown. In this paper, we prove that for binary distributions,
  each of these probabilistic circuit models is equivalent in the sense that any circuit
  for one of them can be transformed into a circuit for any of the others with only
  a polynomial increase in size. They are therefore all tractable for marginal inference
  on the same class of distributions. Finally, we explore the natural extension of
  one such polynomial semantics, called probabilistic generating circuits, to categorical
  random variables, and establish that marginal inference becomes #P-hard.'
