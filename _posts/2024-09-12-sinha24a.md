title: BanditQ:Fair Bandits with Guaranteed Rewards
abstract: Classic no-regret multi-armed bandit algorithms, including the Upper Confidence
  Bound (UCB), Hedge, and EXP3, are inherently unfair by design. Their unfairness
  stems from their objective of playing the most rewarding arm as frequently as possible
  while ignoring the rest. In this paper, we consider a fair prediction problem in
  the stochastic setting with a guaranteed minimum rate of accrual of rewards for
  each arm. We study the problem in both full-information and bandit feedback settings.
  Combining queueing-theoretic techniques with adversarial bandits, we propose a new
  online policy called BanditQ that achieves the target reward rates while conceding
  a regret and target rate violation penalty of at most $O(T^{\frac{3}{4}}).$ The
  regret bound in the full-information setting can be further improved to $O(\sqrt{T})$
  under either a monotonicity assumption or when considering time-averaged regret.
  The proposed policy is efficient and admits a black-box reduction from the fair
  prediction problem to the standard adversarial MAB problem. The analysis of the
  BanditQ policy involves a new self-bounding inequality, which might be of independent
  interest.
