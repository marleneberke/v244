title: Partial identification of the maximum mean discrepancy with mismeasured data
abstract: 'Nonparametric estimates of the distance between two distributions such
  as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are often used in machine learning applications.
  However, the majority of existing literature assumes that error-free samples from
  the two distributions of interest are available.We relax this assumption and study
  the estimation of the MMD under $\epsilon$-contamination, where a possibly non-random
  $\epsilon$ proportion of one distribution is erroneously grouped with the other.
  We show that under $\epsilon$-contamination, the typical estimate of the MMD is
  unreliable. Instead, we study partial identification of the MMD, and characterize
  sharp upper and lower bounds that contain the true, unknown MMD. We propose a method
  to estimate these bounds, and show that it gives estimates that converge to the
  sharpest possible bounds on the MMD as sample size increases, with a convergence
  rate that is faster than alternative approaches. Using three datasets, we empirically
  validate that our approach is superior to the alternatives: it gives tight bounds
  with a low false coverage rate.'
