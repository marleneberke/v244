title: Neural Optimal Transport with Lagrangian Costs
abstract: We investigate the optimal transport problem between probability measures
  when the underlying cost function is understood to satisfy a least action principle,
  also known as a Lagrangian cost. These generalizations are useful when connecting
  observations from a physical system where the transport dynamics are influenced
  by the geometry of the system, such as obstacles (e.g., incorporating barrier functions
  in the Lagrangian), and allows practitioners to incorporate a priori knowledge of
  the underlying system such as non-Euclidean geometries (e.g., paths must be circular).
  Our contributions are of computational interest, where we demonstrate the ability
  to efficiently compute geodesics and amortize spline-based paths, which has not
  been done before, even in low dimensional problems. Unlike prior work, we also output
  the resulting Lagrangian optimal transport map without requiring an ODE solver.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation on low-dimensional examples
  taken from  prior work. The source code to reproduce our experiments is available
