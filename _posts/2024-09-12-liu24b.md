title: Patch-Prompt Aligned Bayesian Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models
abstract: 'For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there
  has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works
  on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize
  the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics
  of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic
  resolution to prompt tuning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated
  hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution
  and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically
  regularize the tuning process by minimizing the statistic distance between the visual
  patches and linguistic prompts, which pushes the stochastic label representations
  to faithfully capture diverse visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training
  categories. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four tasks: few-shot
  image recognition, base-to-new generalization, dataset transfer learning, and domain
  shifts. Extensive results on over 15 datasets show promising transferability and
  generalization performance of our proposed model, both quantitatively and qualitatively.'
