title: Approximate Bayesian Computation with Path Signatures
abstract: Simulation models often lack tractable likelihood functions, making likelihood-free
  inference methods indispensable. Approximate Bayesian computation generates likelihood-free
  posterior samples by comparing simulated and observed data through some distance
  measure, but existing approaches are often poorly suited to time series simulators,
  for example due to an independent and identically distributed data assumption. In
  this paper, we propose to use path signatures in approximate Bayesian computation
  to handle the sequential nature of time series. We provide theoretical guarantees
  on the resultant posteriors and demonstrate competitive Bayesian parameter inference
  for simulators generating univariate, multivariate, and irregularly spaced sequences
  of non-iid data.
