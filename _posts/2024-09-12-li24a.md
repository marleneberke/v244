title: Label Consistency-based Worker Filtering for Crowdsourcing
abstract: In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can obtain multiple noisy labels from different
  crowd workers on the Internet for each instance and then infer its unknown true
  label via a label integration method. However, noisy labels often have a serious
  negative impact on label integration. In this case, most existing works always focus
  on designing more complex label integration methods to infer unknown true labels
  more accurately from multiple noisy labels, but little attention has been paid to
  another perspective, i.e., purifying noisy labels before label integration. In this
  paper, we aim to purify noisy labels for existing label integration methods and
  propose a label consistency-based worker filtering (LCWF) algorithm. In LCWF, we
  consider that if all low-quality workers are filtered out and only high-quality
  workers remain, the label consistency should be high. Therefore, we utilize label
  consistency to filter out low-quality workers. Firstly, we directly transform the
  worker filtering problem into a discrete optimization problem and utilize label
  consistency to define the fitness function for this problem. Then, we search for
  the optimal solution to this problem by a genetic algorithm. Finally, we filter
  out all labels from low-quality workers according to the optimal solution we obtained.
  Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that LCWF
  can effectively purify noisy labels and improve the integration accuracy of existing
  label integration methods.
