title: Trusted re-weighting for label distribution learning
abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a novel machine learning paradigm that
  aims to shift 0/1 labels into descriptive degrees to characterize the polysemy of
  instances. Since the description degree takes a value between 0 \ensuremath{\sim}
  1, it is difficult for the annotator to accurately annotate each label. Therefore,
  the predictive ability of numerous LDL algorithms may be degraded by the presence
  of noise in the label space. To address this problem, we propose a novel stability-trust
  LDL framework that aims to reconstruct the feature space of an arbitrary LDL dataset
  by using feature decoupling and prototype guidance. Specifically, first, we use
  prototype learning to select reliable cluster centers (representative vectors of
  label distributions) to filter out a set of clean samples (with labeled noise) on
  the original dataset. Then, we decouple the feature space (eliminating correlations
  among features) by modeling a weight assigner that is learned on this clean sample
  set, thus assigning weights to each sample of the original dataset. Finally, all
  existing LDL algorithms can be trained on this new re-weighted dataset for the goal
  of robust modeling. In addition, we create a new image dataset to support the training
  and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  framework boosts the performance of the LDL algorithm on datasets with label noise.
