title: Iterated INLA for State and Parameter Estimation in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
abstract: Data assimilation (DA) methods use priors arising from differential equations
  to robustly interpolate and extrapolate data. Popular techniques such as ensemble
  methods that handle high-dimensional, nonlinear PDE priors focus mostly on state
  estimation, however can have difficulty learning the parameters accurately. On the
  other hand, machine learning based approaches can naturally learn the state and
  parameters, but their applicability can be limited, or produce uncertainties that
  are hard to interpret. Inspired by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)
  method in spatial statistics, we propose an alternative approach to DA based on
  iteratively linearising the dynamical model. This produces a Gaussian Markov random
  field at each iteration, enabling one to use INLA to infer the state and parameters.
  Our approach can be used for arbitrary nonlinear systems, while retaining interpretability,
  and is furthermore demonstrated to outperform existing methods on the DA task. By
  providing a more nuanced approach to handling nonlinear PDE priors, our methodology
  offers improved accuracy and robustness in predictions, especially where data sparsity
  is prevalent.
