title: Quantum Kernelized Bandits
abstract: We consider the quantum kernelized bandit problem, where the player observes
  information of rewards through quantum circuits termed the quantum reward oracle,
  and the mean reward function belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
  We propose a UCB-type algorithm that utilizes the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method
  and provide regret bounds in terms of the decay rate of eigenvalues of the Mercer
  operator of the kernel. Our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}\left( T^{\frac{3}{1
  + \beta_p}} \log\left(\frac{1}{\delta} \right)\right)$ and $\widetilde{O} \left(
  \log^{3(1 + \beta_e^{-1})/2} (T) \log\left(\frac{1 }{\delta} \right) \right)$ cumulative
  regret bounds with probability at least $1-\delta$ if the kernel has a $\beta_p$-polynomial
  eigendecay and $\beta_e$-exponential eigendecay, respectively. In particular, in
  the case of the exponential eigendecay, our regret bounds exponentially improve
  that of classical algorithms. Moreover, our results indicate that our regret bound
  is better than the lower bound in the classical kernelized bandit problem if the
  rate of decay is sufficiently fast.
