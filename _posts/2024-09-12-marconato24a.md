title: BEARS Make Neuro-Symbolic Models Aware of their Reasoning Shortcuts
abstract: 'Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) predictors that conform to symbolic knowledge {–}
  encoding, e.g., safety constraints {–} can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs):
  They learn concepts consistent with the symbolic knowledge by exploiting unintended
  semantics. RSs compromise reliability and generalization and, as we show in this
  paper, they are linked to NeSy models being overconfident about the predicted concepts.
  Unfortunately, the only trustworthy mitigation strategy requires collecting costly
  dense supervision over the concepts. Rather than attempting to avoid RSs altogether,
  we propose to ensure NeSy models are aware of the semantic ambiguity of the concepts
  they learn, thus enabling their users to identify and distrust low-quality concepts.
  Starting from three simple desiderata, we derive bears (BE Aware of Reasoning Shortcuts),
  an ensembling technique that calibrates the model’s concept-level confidence without
  compromising prediction accuracy, thus encouraging NeSy architectures to be uncertain
  about concepts affected by RSs. We show empirically that bears improves RS-awareness
  of several state-of-the-art NeSy models, and also facilitates acquiring informative
  dense annotations for mitigation purposes.'
