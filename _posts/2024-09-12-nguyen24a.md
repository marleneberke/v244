title: Cold-start Recommendation by Personalized Embedding Region Elicitation
abstract: Rating elicitation is a success element for recommender systems to perform
  well at cold-starting, in which the systems need to recommend items to a newly arrived
  user with no prior knowledge about the user’s preference. Existing elicitation methods
  employ a fixed set of items to learn the user’s preference and then infer the users’
  preferences on the remaining items. Using a fixed seed set can limit the performance
  of the recommendation system since the seed set is unlikely optimal for all new
  users with potentially diverse preferences. This paper addresses this challenge
  using a 2-phase, personalized elicitation scheme. First, the elicitation scheme
  asks users to rate a small set of popular items in a “burn-in” phase. Second, it
  sequentially asks the user to rate adaptive items to refine the preference and the
  user’s representation. Throughout the process, the system represents the user’s
  embedding value not by a point estimate but by a region estimate. The value of information
  obtained by asking the user’s rating on an item is quantified by the distance from
  the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding
  value of the user. Finally, the recommendations are successively generated by considering
  the preference region of the user. We show that each subproblem in the elicitation
  scheme can be efficiently implemented. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method against existing rating-elicitation methods on several prominent
  datasets.
