title: 'ILP-FORMER: Solving Integer Linear Programming with Sequence to Multi-Label
  Learning'
abstract: Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is an essential class of combinatorial
  optimization problems (COPs). Its inherent NP-hardness has fostered considerable
  efforts towards the development of heuristic strategies. An emerging approach involves
  leveraging data-driven methods to automatically learn these heuristics. For example,
  using deep (reinforcement) learning to recurrently reoptimize an initial solution
  with Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) has demonstrated exceptional performance across
  numerous applications. A pivotal challenge within LNS lies in identifying an optimal
  subset of variables for reoptimization at each stage. Existing methods typically
  learn a policy to select a subset, either by maintaining a fixed cardinality or
  by decomposing the subset into independent binary decisions for each variable. However,
  such strategies overlook the modeling of LNSâ€™s sequential processes and fail to
  explore the correlations inherent in variable selection. To overcome these shortcomings,
  we introduce ILP-FORMER, an innovative model that reimagines policy learning as
  a sequence-to-multi-label classification (MLC) problem. Our approach uniquely integrates
  a  causal transformer encoder to capture the sequential nature of LNS. Additionally,
  we employ an MLC decoder with contrastive learning to exploit the correlations in
  variable selection. Our extensive experiments confirm that ILP-FORMER delivers state-of-the-art
  anytime performance on several ILP benchmarks. Furthermore, ILP-FORMER exhibits
  impressive generalization capabilities when dealing with larger problem instances.
