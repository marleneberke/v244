title: Anomaly Detection with Variance Stabilized Density Estimation
abstract: We propose a modified density estimation problem that is highly effective
  for detecting anomalies in tabular data. Our approach assumes that the density function
  is relatively stable (with lower variance) around normal samples. We have verified
  this hypothesis empirically using a wide range of real-world data. Then, we present
  a variance-stabilized density estimation problem for maximizing the likelihood of
  the observed samples while minimizing the variance of the density around normal
  samples. To obtain a reliable anomaly detector, we introduce a spectral ensemble
  of autoregressive models for learning the variance-stabilized distribution. We have
  conducted an extensive benchmark with 52 datasets, demonstrating that our method
  leads to state-of-the-art results while alleviating the need for data-specific hyperparameter
  tuning. Finally, we have used an ablation study to demonstrate the importance of
  each of the proposed components, followed by a stability analysis evaluating the
  robustness of our model.
