title: 'The Real Deal Behind the Artificial Appeal: Inferential Utility of Tabular
  Synthetic Data'
abstract: Recent advances in generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic
  data to be made available for research in privacy-sensitive contexts. However, the
  analysis of synthetic data raises a unique set of methodological challenges. In
  this work, we highlight the importance of inferential utility and provide empirical
  evidence against naive inference from synthetic data, whereby synthetic data are
  treated as if they were actually observed. Before publishing synthetic data, it
  is essential to develop statistical inference tools for such data. By means of a
  simulation study, we show that the rate of false-positive findings (type 1 error)
  will be unacceptably high, even when the estimates are unbiased. Despite the use
  of a previously proposed correction factor, this problem persists for deep generative
  models, in part due to slower convergence of estimators and resulting underestimation
  of the true standard error. We further demonstrate our findings through a case study.
