title: Consistency Regularization for Domain Generalization with Logit Attribution
  Matching
abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is about training models that generalize well
  under domain shift. Previous research on DG has been conducted mostly in single-source
  or multi-source settings. In this paper, we consider a third lesser-known setting
  where a training domain is endowed with a collection of pairs of examples that share
  the same semantic information. Such semantic sharing (SS) pairs can be created via
  data augmentation and then utilized for consistency regularization (CR). We present
  a theory showing CR is conducive to DG and propose a novel CR method called Logit
  Attribution Matching (LAM). We conduct experiments on five DG benchmarks and four
  pretrained models with SS pairs created by both generic and targeted data augmentation
  methods. LAM outperforms representative single/multi-source DG methods and various
  CR methods that leverage SS pairs. The code and data of this project are available
  at https://github.com/Gaohan123/LAM.
