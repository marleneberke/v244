title: Bounding causal effects with leaky instruments
abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular and powerful tool for estimating
  causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, classical approaches
  rely on strong assumptions such as the <em>exclusion criterion</em>, which states
  that instrumental effects must be entirely mediated by treatments. This assumption
  often fails in practice. When IV methods are improperly applied to data that do
  not meet the exclusion criterion, estimated causal effects may be badly biased.
  In this work, we propose a novel solution that provides <em>partial</em> identification
  in linear systems given a set of <em>leaky instruments</em>, which are allowed to
  violate the exclusion criterion to some limited degree. We derive a convex optimization
  objective that provides provably sharp bounds on the average treatment effect under
  some common forms of information leakage, and implement inference procedures to
  quantify the uncertainty of resulting estimates. We demonstrate our method in a
  set of experiments with simulated data, where it performs favorably against the
  state of the art. An accompanying $\texttt{R}$ package, $\texttt{leakyIV}$, is available
  from $\texttt{CRAN}$.
