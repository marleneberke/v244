title: Support Recovery in Sparse PCA with General Missing Data
abstract: We analyze a sparse PCA algorithm for incomplete and noisy data without
  any specific model assumption on the data missing scheme. We utilize a graphical
  approach to characterize general missing patterns, which enables us to analyze the
  effect of structural properties of missing patterns on the solvability of sparse
  PCA problem. The sparse PCA method we focus on is a semidefinite relaxation of the
  $\ell_1$-regularized PCA problem. We provide theoretical justification that  the
  support of the sparse leading eigenvector can be recovered with high probability
  using the algorithm, under certain conditions. The conditions involve the spectral
  gap between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the true data matrix,
  the magnitude of the noise, and the structural properties of the missing pattern.
  The concepts of algebraic connectivity and irregularity are used to describe the
  properties in a graphical way. We empirically justify our theorem with synthetic
  data analysis. We show that the SDP algorithm outperforms other sparse PCA approaches
  especially when the observation pattern has good structural properties. As a by-product
  of our analysis, we provide two theorems to handle general missing schemes, which
  can be applied to other problems related to incomplete data matrices.
