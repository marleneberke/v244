title: Publishing Number of Walks and Katz Centrality under Local Differential Privacy
abstract: In our study, we present an algorithm for publishing the count of walks
  and Katz centrality under local differential privacy (LDP), complemented by a comprehensive
  theoretical analysis. While previous research in LDP has predominantly focused on
  counting subgraphs with a maximum of five nodes, our work extends this to larger
  subgraphs. The primary challenge in such an extension lies in managing the exponentially
  increasing noise associated with LDP as the size of the subgraph grows. Our solution
  involves an algorithm for publishing the count of walks originating from each node
  in the graph, which subsequently enables us to publish the Katz centrality of all
  nodes. This algorithm incorporates multiple communication rounds and employs a clipping
  technique. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that
  our algorithm achieves has a relatively small bias and variance, showing significant
  improvements over both the randomized response method and non-clipping algorithms.
  Additionally, our approach to estimating Katz centrality successfully identifies
  up to 90% of the nodes with the highest centrality values.
