title: "\\ensuremathα-Former: Local-Feature-Aware (L-FA) Transformer"
abstract: Despite the success of current segmentation models powered by the transformer,
  the camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) task remains a challenge due to the
  similarity between the target and the background. To address this issue, we propose
  a novel approach called the local-feature-aware transformer ($\alpha$-Former), inspired
  by how humans find the camouflaged instance in a given photograph. We use traditional
  computer vision descriptors to simulate how humans find the unnatural boundary in
  a given photograph. Then, the information extracted by traditional descriptors can
  be employed as prior knowledge to enhance the neural network’s performance. Moreover,
  due to the non-learnable characteristics of traditional descriptors, we designed
  a learnable binary filter to simulate the traditional descriptors. In order to aggregate
  the information from the backbone and binary filter, we introduce an adapter to
  merge local features into the transformer framework. Additionally, we introduce
  an edge-aware feature fusion module to improve boundary results in the segmentation
  model. Using the proposed transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, our $\alpha$-Former
  surpasses state-of-the-art performance on the COD10K and NC4K datasets.
