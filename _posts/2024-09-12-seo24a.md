title: Unsupervised Feature Selection towards Pattern Discrimination Power
abstract: The goal of unsupervised feature selection is to identify a feature subset
  based on the intrinsic characteristics of a given dataset without user-guided information
  such as class variables. To achieve this, score functions based on information measures
  can be used to identify essential features. The major research direction of conventional
  information-theoretic unsupervised feature selection is to minimize the entropy
  of the final feature subset. Although the opposite way, i.e., maximization of the
  joint entropy, can also lead to novel insights, studies in this direction are rare.
  For example, in the field of information retrieval, selected features that maximize
  the joint entropy of a feature subset can be effective discriminators for reaching
  the target tuple in the database. Thus, in this work, we first demonstrate how two
  feature subsets, each obtained by minimizing/maximizing the joint entropy, respectively,
  are different based on a toy dataset. By comparing these two feature subsets, we
  show that the maximization of the joint entropy enhances the pattern discrimination
  power of the feature subset. Then, we derive a score function by remedying joint
  entropy calculation; high-dimensional joint entropy calculation is circumvented
  by using the low-order approximation. The experimental results on 30 public datasets
  indicate that the proposed method yields superior performance in terms of pattern
  discrimination power-related measures.
