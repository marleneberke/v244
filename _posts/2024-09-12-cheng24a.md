title: 'SMuCo: Reinforcement Learning for Visual Control via Sequential Multi-view
  Total Correlation'
abstract: The advent of abundant image data has catalyzed the advancement of visual
  control in reinforcement learning (RL) systems, leveraging multiple view- points
  to capture the same physical states, which could enhance control performance theoretically.
  However, integrating multi-view data into representation learning remains challenging.
  In this paper, we introduce SMuCo, an innovative multi-view reinforcement learning
  algorithm that constructs robust latent representations by optimizing multi- view
  sequential total correlation. This technique effectively captures task-relevant
  information and temporal dynamics while filtering out irrelevant data. Our method
  supports an unlimited number of views and demonstrates superior performance over
  leading model-free and model-based RL algorithms. Empirical results from the DeepMind
  Control Suite and the Sapien Basic Manipulation Task confirm SMuCoâ€™s enhanced efficacy,
  significantly improving task performance across diverse scenarios and views.
