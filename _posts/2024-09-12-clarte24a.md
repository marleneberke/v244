title: Analysis of Bootstrap and Subsampling in High-dimensional Regularized Regression
abstract: 'We investigate popular resampling methods for estimating the uncertainty
  of statistical models, such as subsampling, bootstrap and the jackknife, and their
  performance in high-dimensional supervised regression tasks. We provide a tight
  asymptotic description of the biases and variances estimated by these methods in
  the context of generalized linear models, such as ridge and logistic regression,
  taking the limit where the number of samples $n$ and dimension $d$ of the covariates
  grow at a comparable rate: $\alpha=n/d$ fixed. Our findings are three-fold: i) resampling
  methods are fraught with problems in high dimensions and exhibit the double-descent-like
  behavior typical of these situations; ii) only when $\alpha$ is large enough do
  they provide consistent and reliable error estimations (we give convergence rates);
  iii) in the over-parametrized regime $\alpha<1$ relevant to modern machine learning
  practice, their predictions are not consistent, even with optimal regularization.'
