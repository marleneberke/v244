title: Multi-Relational Structural Entropy
abstract: Structural Entropy (SE) measures the structural information contained in
  a graph. Minimizing or maximizing SE helps to reveal or obscure the intrinsic structural
  patterns underlying graphs in an interpretable manner, finding applications in various
  tasks driven by networked data. However, SE ignores the heterogeneity inherent in
  the graph relations, which is ubiquitous in modern networks. In this work, we extend
  SE to consider heterogeneous relations and propose the first metric for multi-relational
  graph structural information, namely, Multi-relational Structural Entropy (MrSE).
  To this end, we first cast SE through the novel lens of the stationary distribution
  from random surfing, which readily extends to multi-relational networks by considering
  the choices of both nodes and relation types simultaneously at each step. The resulting
  MrSE is then optimized by a new greedy algorithm to reveal the essential structures
  within a multi-relational network. Experimental results highlight that the proposed
  MrSE offers a more insightful interpretation of the structure of multi-relational
  graphs compared to SE. Additionally, it enhances the performance of two tasks that
  involve real-world multi-relational graphs, including node clustering and social
  event detection.
