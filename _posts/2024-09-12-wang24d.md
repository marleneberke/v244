title: Metric Learning from Limited Pairwise Preference Comparisons
abstract: We study metric learning from preference comparisons under the ideal point
  model, in which a user prefers an item over another if it is closer to their latent
  ideal item. These items are embedded into $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with an unknown
  Mahalanobis distance shared across users. While recent work shows that it is possible
  to simultaneously recover the metric and ideal items given $\mathcal{O}(d)$ pairwise
  comparisons per user, in practice we often have a limited budget of $o(d)$ comparisons.
  We study whether the metric can still be recovered, even though learning individual
  ideal items is now no longer possible. We show that, on the one hand, $o(d)$ comparisons
  may not reveal any information about the metric, even with infinitely many users.
  On the other hand, when comparisons are made over items that exhibit low-dimensional
  structure, each user can contribute to learning the metric restricted to a low-dimensional
  subspace so that the metric can be jointly identified. We present a divide-and-conquer
  approach that achieves this, and provide theoretical recovery guarantees and empirical
  validation.
