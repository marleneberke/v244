title: Detecting critical treatment effect bias in small subgroups
abstract: Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions
  in medicine. However, they are often not representative of the patient population
  in clinical practice.  Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader
  patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using observational
  data for any downstream task, it is crucial to benchmark its treatment effect estimates
  against a randomized trial.  We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational
  studies on a subgroup level. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis
  that the treatment effects – conditioned on a subset of relevant features –  differ
  up to some tolerance value. Our test allows us to estimate an asymptotically valid
  lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup.  We validate our lower
  bound in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with
  established medical knowledge.
