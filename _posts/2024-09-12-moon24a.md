title: Optimistic Regret Bounds for Online Learning in Adversarial Markov Decision
  Processes
abstract: The Adversarial Markov Decision Process (AMDP) is a learning framework that
  deals with unknown and varying tasks in decision-making applications like robotics
  and recommendation systems. A major limitation of the AMDP formalism, however, is
  pessimistic regret analysis results in the sense that although the cost function
  can change from one episode to the next, the evolution in many settings is not adversarial.
  To address this, we introduce and study a new variant of AMDP, which aims to minimize
  regret while utilizing a set of cost predictors. For this setting, we develop a
  new policy search method that achieves a sublinear optimistic regret with high probability,
  that is a regret bound which gracefully degrades with the estimation power of the
  cost predictors. Establishing such optimistic regret bounds is nontrivial given
  that (i) as we demonstrate, the existing importance-weighted cost estimators cannot
  establish optimistic bounds, and (ii) the feedback model of AMDP is different (and
  more realistic) than the existing optimistic online learning works. Our result,
  in particular, hinges upon developing a novel optimistically biased cost estimator
  that leverages cost predictors and enables a high-probability regret analysis without
  imposing restrictive assumptions. We further discuss practical extensions of the
  proposed scheme and demonstrate its efficacy numerically.
