title: End-to-End Learning for Fair Multiobjective Optimization Under Uncertainty
abstract: Many decision processes in artificial intelligence and operations research
  are modeled by parametric optimization problems whose defining parameters are unknown
  and must be inferred from observable data. The Predict-Then-Optimize (PtO) paradigm
  in machine learning aims to maximize downstream decision quality by training the
  parametric inference model end-to-end with the subsequent constrained optimization.
  This requires backpropagation through the optimization problem using approximation
  techniques specific to the problemâ€™s form, especially for nondifferentiable linear
  and mixed-integer programs. This paper extends the PtO methodology to optimization
  problems with nondifferentiable Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) objectives, known
  for their ability to ensure properties of fairness and robustness in decision models.
  Through a collection of training techniques and proposed application settings, it
  shows how optimization of OWA functions can be effectively integrated with parametric
  prediction for fair and robust optimization under uncertainty.
