title: One Shot Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Linear Bandits
abstract: The paradigm of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to specify
  the reward function of an agent purely from its actions and is critical for value
  alignment and AI safety. While IRL is successful in practice, theoretical guarantees
  remain nascent. Motivated by the need for IRL in large action spaces with limited
  data, we consider as a first step the problem of learning from a single sequence
  of actions (i.e., a demonstration) of a stochastic linear bandit algorithm. When
  the demonstrator employs the Phased Elimination algorithm, we develop a simple inverse
  learning procedure that estimates the linear reward function consistently in the
  time horizon with just a <em>single</em> demonstration. In particular, we show that
  our inverse learner approximates the true reward parameter within a error of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{\omega
  - 1}{2\omega }})$ (where $T$ is the length of the demonstratorâ€™s trajectory and
  $\omega$ is a constant that depends on the geometry of the action set). We complement
  this result with an information-theoretic lower bound for any inverse learning procedure.
  We corroborate our theoretical results with simulations on synthetic data and a
  demonstration constructed from the MovieLens dataset.
