title: Probabilistic reconciliation of mixed-type hierarchical time series
abstract: 'Hierarchical time series are collections of time series that are formed
  via aggregation, and thus adhere to some linear constraints. The forecasts for hierarchical
  time series should be coherent, i.e., they should satisfy the same constraints.
  In a probabilistic setting, forecasts are in the form of predictive distributions.  Probabilistic
  reconciliation adjusts the predictive distributions, yielding a joint reconciled
  distribution that assigns positive probability only to coherent forecasts. There
  are methods for the reconciliation of hierarchies containing only Gaussian or only
  discrete predictive distributions; instead, the reconciliation of mixed hierarchies,
  i.e. mixtures of discrete and continuous time series, is still an open problem.  We
  propose two different approaches to address this problem: mixed conditioning and
  top-down conditioning. We discuss their properties and we present experiments with
  datasets containing up to thousands of time series.'
