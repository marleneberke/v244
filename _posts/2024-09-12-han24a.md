title: Characterizing Data Point Vulnerability as Average-Case Robustness
abstract: 'Studying the robustness of machine learning models is important to ensure
  consistent model behaviour across real-world settings. To this end, adversarial
  robustness is a standard framework, which views robustness of predictions through
  a binary lens: either a worst-case adversarial perturbation exists in the local
  region around an input, or it does not. However, this binary perspective does not
  account for the degrees of vulnerability, as data points with a larger number of
  misclassified examples in their neighborhoods are more vulnerable. In this work,
  we consider a complementary framework for robustness, called average-case robustness,
  which measures the fraction of points in a local region that provides consistent
  predictions. However, computing this quantity is hard, as standard Monte Carlo approaches
  are inefficient especially for high-dimensional inputs. In this work, we propose
  the first analytical estimators for average-case robustness for multi-class classifiers.
  We show empirically that our estimators are accurate and efficient for standard
  deep learning models and demonstrate their usefulness for identifying vulnerable
  data points, and well as quantifying robustness bias of models. Overall, our tools
  provide a complementary view to robustness, improving our ability to characterize
  model behaviour.'
