title: 'Local Discovery by Partitioning: Polynomial-Time Causal Discovery Around Exposure-Outcome
  Pairs'
abstract: 'Causal discovery is crucial for causal inference in observational studies,
  as it can enable the identification of *valid adjustment sets* (VAS) for unbiased
  effect estimation. However,  global causal discovery is notoriously hard in the
  nonparametric setting, with exponential time and sample complexity in the worst
  case. To address this, we propose *local discovery by partitioning* (LDP): a local
  causal discovery method that is tailored for downstream inference tasks without
  requiring parametric and pretreatment assumptions. LDP is a constraint-based procedure
  that returns a VAS for an exposure-outcome pair under latent confounding, given
  sufficient conditions. The total number of independence tests performed is worst-case
  quadratic with respect to the cardinality of the variable set. Asymptotic theoretical
  guarantees are numerically validated on synthetic graphs. Adjustment sets from LDP
  yield less biased and more precise average treatment effect estimates than baseline
  discovery algorithms, with LDP outperforming on confounder recall, runtime, and
  test count for VAS discovery. Notably, LDP ran at least $1300\times$ faster than
  baselines on a benchmark.'
