title: 'Beyond Dirichlet-based Models: When Bayesian Neural Networks Meet Evidential
  Deep Learning'
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) excel in uncertainty quantification (UQ)
  by estimating the posterior distribution of model parameters, yet face challenges
  due to the high computational demands of Bayesian inference. Evidential deep learning
  methods address this by treating target distribution parameters as random variables
  with a learnable conjugate distribution, enabling efficient UQ. However, thereâ€™s
  debate over whether these methods can accurately estimate epistemic uncertainty
  due to their single-network, sampling-free nature. In this paper, we combine the
  strengths of both approaches by distilling BNN knowledge into a Dirichlet-based
  model, endowing it with a Bayesian perspective and theoretical guarantees. Additionally,
  we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ
  with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we
  introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA)
  for self-distillation. To alleviate the conjugate prior assumption, we employ an
  expressive normalizing flow for refining the model in a post-processing manner,
  where a few training iterations can enhance model performance. The experimental
  results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in both UQ accuracy
  and robustness.
