title: Optimization Framework for Semi-supervised Attributed Graph Coarsening
abstract: In data-intensive applications, graphs serve as foundational structures
  across various domains. However, the increasing size of datasets poses significant
  challenges to performing downstream tasks. To address this problem, techniques such
  as graph coarsening, condensation, and summarization have been developed to create
  a coarsened graph while preserving important properties of the original graph by
  considering both the graph matrix and the feature or attribute matrix of the original
  graph as inputs. However, existing graph coarsening techniques often neglect the
  label information during the coarsening process, which can result in a lower-quality
  coarsened graph and limit its suitability for downstream tasks.  To overcome this
  limitation, we introduce the Label-Aware Graph Coarsening (LAGC) algorithm, a semi-supervised
  approach that incorporates the graph matrix, feature matrix, and some of the node
  label information to learn a coarsened graph. Our proposed formulation is a non-convex
  optimization problem that is efficiently solved using  block successive upper bound
  minimization(BSUM) technique, and it is provably convergent. Our extensive results
  demonstrate that the LAGC algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method
  by a significant margin.
