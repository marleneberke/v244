title: Unified PAC-Bayesian Study of Pessimism for Offline Policy Learning with Regularized
  Importance Sampling
abstract: Off-policy learning (OPL) often involves minimizing a risk estimator based
  on importance weighting to correct bias from the logging policy used to collect
  data. However, this method can produce an estimator with a high variance. A common
  solution is to regularize the importance weights and learn the policy by minimizing
  an estimator with penalties derived from generalization bounds specific to the estimator.
  This approach, known as pessimism, has gained recent attention but lacks a unified
  framework for analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive PAC-Bayesian
  framework to examine pessimism with regularized importance weighting. We derive
  a tractable PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that universally applies to common
  importance weight regularizations, enabling their comparison within a single framework.
  Our empirical results challenge common understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of standard IW regularization techniques.
