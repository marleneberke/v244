title: Privacy-Aware Randomized Quantization via Linear Programming
abstract: Differential privacy mechanisms such as the Gaussian or Laplace mechanism
  have been widely used in data analytics for preserving individual privacy. However,
  they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for scenarios
  where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization mechanisms were
  proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under differential privacy, the outcomes
  are either biased or have an inferior accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper,
  we propose a family of quantization mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially
  private. It has a high degree of freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms
  can be considered as special cases of ours. To find the optimal mechanism, we formulate
  a linear optimization that can be solved efficiently using linear programming tools.
  Experiments show that our proposed mechanism can attain a better privacy-accuracy
  trade-off compared to baselines.
