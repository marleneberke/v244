title: Group Fairness in Predict-Then-Optimize Settings for Restless Bandits
abstract: Restless multi-arm bandits (RMABs) are a model for sequentially allocating
  a limited number of resources to agents modeled as Markov Decision Processes. RMABs
  have applications in cellular networks, anti-poaching, and in particular, healthcare.
  For such high-stakes use cases, allocations are often required to treat different
  groups of agents (e.g., defined by sensitive attributes) fairly. In addition to
  the fairness challenge, agentsâ€™ transition probabilities are often unknown and need
  to be learned in real-world problems.   Thus, group fairness in RMABs requires us
  to simultaneously learn transition probabilities and how much budget we allocate
  to each group. Overcoming this key challenge ignored by previous work, we develop
  a decision-focused-learning pipeline to solve equitable RMABs, using a novel budget
  allocation algorithm to prevent disparity between groups. Our results on both synthetic
  and real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that incorporating fair planning
  into the learning step greatly improves equity with little sacrifice in utility.
