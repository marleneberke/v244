title: 'How to Fix a Broken Confidence Estimator: Evaluating Post-hoc Methods for
  Selective Classification with Deep Neural Networks'
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of selective classification for deep neural
  networks, where a model is allowed to abstain from low-confidence predictions to
  avoid potential errors. We focus on so-called post-hoc methods, which replace the
  confidence estimator of a given classifier without modifying or retraining it, thus
  being practically appealing. Considering neural networks with softmax outputs, our
  goal is to identify the best confidence estimator that can be computed directly
  from the unnormalized logits. This problem is motivated by the intriguing observation
  in recent work that many classifiers appear to have a “broken” confidence estimator,
  in the sense that their selective classification performance is much worse than
  what could be expected by their corresponding accuracies. We perform an extensive
  experimental study of many existing and proposed confidence estimators applied to
  84 pretrained ImageNet classifiers available from popular repositories. Our results
  show that a simple $p$-norm normalization of the logits, followed by taking the
  maximum logit as the confidence estimator, can lead to considerable gains in selective
  classification performance, completely fixing the pathological behavior observed
  in many classifiers. As a consequence, the selective classification performance
  of any classifier becomes almost entirely determined by its corresponding accuracy.
  Moreover, these results are shown to be consistent under distribution shift.
