title: 'Shedding Light on Large Generative Networks: Estimating Epistemic Uncertainty
  in Diffusion Models'
abstract: Generative diffusion models, notable for their large parameter count (exceeding
  100 million) and operation within high-dimensional image spaces, pose significant
  challenges for traditional uncertainty estimation methods due to computational demands.
  In this work, we introduce an innovative framework, Diffusion Ensembles for Capturing
  Uncertainty (DECU), designed for estimating epistemic uncertainty for diffusion
  models. The DECU framework introduces a novel method that efficiently trains ensembles
  of conditional diffusion models by incorporating a static set of pre-trained parameters,
  drastically reducing the computational burden and the number of parameters that
  require training. Additionally, DECU employs Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs)
  to accurately measure epistemic uncertainty by evaluating the mutual information
  between model outputs and weights in high-dimensional spaces. The effectiveness
  of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on the ImageNet dataset, highlighting
  its capability to capture epistemic uncertainty, specifically in under-sampled image
  classes.
