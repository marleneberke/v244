title: Posterior Inference on Shallow Infinitely Wide Bayesian Neural Networks under
  Weights with Unbounded Variance
abstract: From the classical and influential works of Neal (1996), it is known that
  the infinite width scaling limit of a Bayesian neural network with one hidden layer
  is a Gaussian process, when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Nealâ€™s
  result has been extended to networks with multiple hidden layers and to convolutional
  neural networks, also with Gaussian process scaling limits. The tractable properties
  of Gaussian processes then allow straightforward posterior inference and uncertainty
  quantification, considerably simplifying the study of the limit process compared
  to a network of finite width. Neural network weights with unbounded variance, however,
  pose unique challenges. In this case, the classical central limit theorem breaks
  down and it is well known that the scaling limit is an $\alpha$-stable process under
  suitable conditions. However, current literature is primarily limited to forward
  simulations under these processes and the problem of posterior inference under such
  a scaling limit remains largely unaddressed, unlike in the Gaussian process case.
  To this end, our contribution is an interpretable and computationally efficient
  procedure for posterior inference, using a conditionally Gaussian representation,
  that then allows full use of the Gaussian process machinery for tractable posterior
  inference and uncertainty quantification in the non-Gaussian regime.
