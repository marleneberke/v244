title: Guaranteeing Robustness Against Real-World Perturbations In Time Series Classification
  Using Conformalized Randomized Smoothing
abstract: Certifying the robustness of machine learning models against domain shifts
  and input space perturbations is crucial for many applications, where high risk
  decisions are based on the model’s predictions. Techniques such as randomized smoothing
  have partially addressed this issues with a focus on adversarial attacks in the
  past. In this paper, we generalize randomized smoothing to arbitrary transformations
  and extend it to conformal prediction. The proposed ansatz is demonstrated on a
  time series classifier connected to an automotive use case. We meticulously assess
  the robustness of smooth classifiers in environments subjected to various degrees
  and types of time series native perturbations and compare it against standard conformal
  predictors. The proposed method consistently offers superior resistance to perturbations,
  maintaining high classification accuracy and reliability. Additionally, we are able
  to bound the performance on new domains via calibrating generalization with configuration
  shifts in the training data. In combination, conformalized randomized smoothing
  may offer a model agnostic approach to construct robust classifiers tailored to
  perturbations in their respective applications - a crucial capability for AI assurance
  argumentation.
