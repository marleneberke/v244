title: 'RE-SORT: Removing Spurious Correlation in Multilevel Interaction for CTR Prediction'
abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in recommendation
  systems, serving as the ultimate filtering step to sort items for a user. Most recent
  cutting-edge methods primarily focus on investigating complex implicit and explicit
  feature interactions; however, these methods neglect the spurious correlation issue
  caused by confounding factors, thereby diminishing the modelâ€™s generalization ability.
  We propose a CTR prediction framework that REmoves Spurious cORrelations in mulTilevel
  feature interactions, termed RE-SORT, which has two key components. I. A multilevel
  stacked recurrent (MSR) structure enables the model to efficiently capture diverse
  nonlinear interactions from feature spaces at different levels. II. A spurious correlation
  elimination (SCE) module further leverages Laplacian kernel mapping and sample reweighting
  methods to eliminate the spurious correlations concealed within the multilevel features,
  allowing the model to focus on the true causal features. Extensive experiments conducted
  on four challenging CTR datasets, our production dataset, and an online A/B test
  demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
  accuracy and speed. The utilized codes, models, and dataset will be released at
  https://github.com/RE-SORT.
