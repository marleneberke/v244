title: Early-Exit Neural Networks with Nested Prediction Sets
abstract: 'Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) facilitate adaptive inference by producing
  predictions at multiple stages of the forward pass. In safety-critical applications,
  these predictions are only meaningful when complemented with reliable uncertainty
  estimates.  Yet, due to their sequential structure, an EENN’s uncertainty estimates
  should also be *consistent*: labels that are deemed improbable at one exit should
  not reappear within the confidence interval / set of later exits.  We show that
  standard uncertainty quantification techniques, like Bayesian methods or conformal
  prediction, can lead to inconsistency across exits. We address this problem by applying
  anytime-valid confidence sequences (AVCSs) to the exits of EENNs.  By design, AVCSs
  maintain consistency across exits. We examine the theoretical and practical challenges
  of applying AVCSs to EENNs and empirically validate our approach on both regression
  and classification tasks.'
