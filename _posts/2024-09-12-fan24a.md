title: Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Multiple Information Sources of Input-dependent
  Fidelity
abstract: By querying approximate surrogate models of different fidelity as available
  information sources, Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (MFBO) aims at optimizing
  unknown functions that are costly if not infeasible to evaluate. Existing MFBO methods
  often assume that approximate surrogates have consistently high/low fidelity across
  the input domain. However, approximate evaluations from the same surrogate can have
  different fidelity at different input regions due to data availability and model
  constraints, especially when considering machine learning surrogates. In this work,
  we investigate MFBO when multi-fidelity approximations have input-dependent fidelity.
  By explicitly capturing input dependency for multi-fidelity queries in Gaussian
  Process (GP), our new input-dependent MFBO (iMFBO) with learnable noise models better
  captures the fidelity of each information source in an intuitive way. We further
  design a new acquisition function for iMFBO and prove that the queries selected
  by iMFBO have higher quality than those by naive MFBO methods, with the derived
  sub-linear regret bound. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
  its superior empirical performance.
