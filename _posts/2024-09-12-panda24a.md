title: Finite-Time Analysis of Three-Timescale Constrained Actor-Critic and Constrained
  Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms.
abstract: Actor Critic methods have found immense applications on a wide range of
  Reinforcement Learning tasks especially when the state-action space is large. In
  this paper, we consider actor critic and natural actor critic algorithms with function
  approximation for constrained Markov decision processes (C-MDP) involving inequality
  constraints and carry out a non-asymptotic analysis for both  of these algorithms
  in a non-i.i.d (Markovian) setting. We consider the long-run average cost criterion
  where both the objective and the constraint functions are suitable policy-dependent
  long-run averages of certain prescribed cost  functions. We handle the inequality
  constraints using the Lagrange multiplier method.  We prove that these algorithms
  are guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\Vert \nabla L(\theta,\gamma)\Vert_2^2
  \leq \epsilon$) of the  performance (Lagrange) function $L(\theta,\gamma)$, with
  a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$  in the case of both
  Constrained Actor Critic (C-AC)  and Constrained Natural Actor Critic (C-NAC) algorithms.
  We also show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments.
