title: Recursively-Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
abstract: Many sequential decision problems involve optimizing one objective function
  while imposing constraints on other objectives. Constrained Partially Observable
  Markov Decision Processes (C-POMDP) model this case with transition uncertainty
  and partial observability. In this work, we first show that C-POMDPs violate the
  optimal substructure property over successive decision steps and thus may exhibit
  behaviors that are undesirable for some (e.g., safety critical) applications. Additionally,
  online re-planning in C-POMDPs is often ineffective due to the inconsistency resulting
  from this violation. To address these drawbacks, we introduce the Recursively-Constrained
  POMDP (RC-POMDP), which imposes additional history-dependent cost constraints on
  the C-POMDP. We show that, unlike C-POMDPs, RC-POMDPs always have deterministic
  optimal policies and that optimal policies obey Bellmanâ€™s principle of optimality.
  We also present a point-based dynamic programming algorithm for RC-POMDPs. Evaluations
  on benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm and show that policies
  for RC-POMDPs produce more desirable behaviors than policies for C-POMDPs.
