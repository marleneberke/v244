title: 'Masking the Unknown: Leveraging Masked Samples for Enhanced Data Augmentation'
abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become a widely adopted strategy for addressing
  data scarcity in numerous NLP tasks, especially in scenarios with limited resources
  or imbalanced classes. However, many existing augmentation techniques rely on randomness
  or additional resources, presenting challenges in both performance and practical
  implementation. Furthermore, there is a lack of exploration into what constitutes
  effective augmentation.  In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing DA methods
  across a comprehensive range of text-classification benchmarks. The empirical analysis
  highlights that the most significant change resulting from augmentation is observed
  in the data variance. This observation inspires the proposed approach, termed Mask-for-Data
  Augmentation (M4DA), which strategically masks tokens from original samples for
  augmentation. Specifically, M4DA consists of a Variance-Oriented Masker Module (VMM),
  which ensures an increase in data variances, and a Complexity-Enhanced Selection
  Module (CSM), designed to select the augmented sample with the highest semantic
  complexity.  The effectiveness of the proposed method is empirically validated across
  various text-classification benchmarks, including scenarios with limited or full
  resources and imbalanced classes. Experimental results demonstrate considerable
  improvements over state-of-the-arts.
