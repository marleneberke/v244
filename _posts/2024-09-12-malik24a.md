title: Identifying Causal Changes Between Linear Structural Equation Models
abstract: Learning the structures of structural equation models (SEMs) as directed
  acyclic graphs (DAGs) from data is crucial for representing causal relationships
  in various scientific domains. Instead of estimating individual DAG structures,
  it is often preferable to directly estimate changes in causal relations between
  conditions, such as changes in genetic expression between healthy and diseased subjects.
  This work studies the problem of directly estimating the difference between two
  linear SEMs, i.e.  *without estimating the individual DAG structures*, given two
  sets of samples drawn from the individual SEMs. We consider general classes of linear
  SEMs where the noise distributions are allowed to be Gaussian or non-Gaussian and
  have different noise variances across the variables in the individual SEMs. We rigorously
  characterize novel conditions related to the topological layering of the structural
  difference that lead to the *identifiability* of the difference DAG (DDAG). Moreover,
  we propose an *efficient* algorithm to identify the DDAG via sequential re-estimation
  of the difference of precision matrices. A surprising implication of our results
  is that causal changes can be identifiable even between *non-identifiable* models
  such as Gaussian SEMs with unequal noise variances. Synthetic experiments are presented
  to validate our theoretical results and to show the scalability of our method.
