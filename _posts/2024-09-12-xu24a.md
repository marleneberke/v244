title: Base Models for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations
abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines
  to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows,
  value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance.  It is often
  necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric
  PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This
  process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming.
  To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding
  solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying
  base distribution.%tasks. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method
  for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally,
  we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments
  in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest
  that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving new PDEs.
