title: A  General Identification Algorithm For Data Fusion Problems Under Systematic
  Selection
abstract: 'Causal inference is made challenging by confounding, selection bias, and
  other complications. A common approach to addressing these difficulties is the inclusion
  of auxiliary data on the superpopulation of interest.  Such data may measure a different
  set of variables, or be obtained under different experimental conditions than the
  primary dataset.  Analysis based on multiple datasets must carefully account for
  similarities between datasets, while appropriately accounting for differences. In
  addition, selection of experimental units into different datasets may be systematic;
  similar  difficulties are encountered in missing data problems.  Existing methods
  for combining datasets either do not consider this issue, or assume simple selection
  mechanisms. In this paper, we provide a general approach, based on graphical causal
  models, for causal inference from data on the same superpopulation that is obtained
  under different experimental conditions.  Our framework allows both arbitrary unobserved
  confounding, and arbitrary selection processes into different experimental regimes
  in our data. We describe how systematic selection processes may be organized into
  a hierarchy similar to censoring processes in missing data: selected completely
  at random (SCAR), selected at random (SAR), and selected not at random (SNAR). In
  addition, we provide a general identification algorithm for interventional distributions
  in this setting.'
