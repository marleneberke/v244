title: A Generalized Bayesian Approach to Distribution-on-Distribution Regression
abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in distribution-on-distribution
  regression, a regression problem where both covariates and responses are represented
  as probability distributions. Despite various methodologies proposed to address
  this challenge, a notable absence has been a Bayesian approach, which offers benefits
  by allowing for the integration of prior knowledge and providing a formal means
  of quantifying uncertainty. However, a major challenge in employing a Bayesian approach
  lies in the complexity of fully specifying the data generating process. To overcome
  this obstacle, we adopt a generalized Bayesian approach and investigate the contraction
  rates of the resulting generalized (Gibbs) posterior distributions. We propose an
  MCMC algorithm to sample from the generalized posterior distribution and conduct
  simulation studies to validate the theoretical findings. Finally, we apply the model
  to a data application involving mortality data.
