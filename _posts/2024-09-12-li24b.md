title: Learning from Crowds with Dual-View K-Nearest Neighbor
abstract: In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can obtain multiple noisy labels from different
  crowd workers for each instance and then infer its integrated label via label integration.
  To achieve better performance, some recently published label integration methods
  have attempted to exploit the multiple noisy labels of inferred instances’ nearest
  neighbors via the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. However, the used KNN algorithm
  searches inferred instances’ nearest neighbors only relying on the defined distance
  functions in the original attribute view and totally ignoring the valuable information
  hidden in the multiple noisy labels, which limits their performance. Motivated by
  multi-view learning, we define the multiple noisy labels as another label view of
  instances and propose to search inferred instances’ nearest neighbors using the
  joint information from both the original attribute view and the multiple noisy label
  view. To this end, we propose a novel label integration method called dual-view
  K-nearest neighbor (DVKNN). In DVKNN, we first define a new distance function to
  search the K-nearest neighbors of an inferred instance. Then, we define a fine-grained
  weight for each noisy label from each neighbor. Finally, we perform weighted majority
  voting (WMV) on all these noisy labels to obtain the integrated label of the inferred
  instance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and rationality of DVKNN.
