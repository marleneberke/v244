title: Walking the Values in Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'The goal of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is recovering
  a posterior distribution over reward functions using a set of demonstrations from
  an expert optimizing for a reward unknown to the learner. The resulting posterior
  over rewards can then be used to synthesize an apprentice policy that performs well
  on the same or a similar task. A key challenge in Bayesian IRL is bridging the computational
  gap between the hypothesis space of possible rewards and the likelihood, often defined
  in terms of Q values: vanilla Bayesian IRL needs to solve the costly forward planning
  problem – going from rewards to the Q values – at every step of the algorithm, which
  may need to be done thousands of times. We propose to solve this by a simple change:
  instead of focusing on primarily sampling in the space of rewards, we can focus
  on primarily working in the space of Q-values, since the computation required to
  go from Q-values to reward is radically cheaper. Furthermore, this reversion of
  the computation makes it easy to compute the gradient allowing efficient sampling
  using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We propose ValueWalk – a new Markov chain Monte Carlo
  method based on this insight – and illustrate its advantages on several tasks.'
