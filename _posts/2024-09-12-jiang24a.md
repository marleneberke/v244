title: On the Convergence of Hierarchical Federated Learning with Partial Worker Participation
abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as the architecture of
  choice for multi-level communication networks, mainly because of its data privacy
  protection and low communication cost. However, existing studies on the convergence
  analysis for HFL are limited to the assumptions of full worker participation and/or
  i.i.d. datasets across workers, both of which rarely hold in practice. Motivated
  by this, we in this work propose a unified convergence analysis framework for HFL
  covering both full and partial worker participation with non-i.i.d. data, non-convex
  objective function and stochastic gradient. We correspondingly develop a three-sided
  learning rates algorithm to mitigate data divergences issue, thereby realizing better
  convergence performance.  Our theoretical results provide key insights of why partial
  participation of HFL is beneficial in significantly reducing the data divergences
  compared to standard FL. Besides, the convergence analysis allows certain individualization
  for each cluster in HFL indicating that adjusting the worker sampling ratio and
  round period can improve the convergence behavior.
