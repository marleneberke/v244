title: Towards Bounding Causal Effects under Markov Equivalence
abstract: Predicting the effect of unseen interventions is a fundamental research
  question across the data sciences. It is well established that in general such questions
  cannot be answered definitively from observational data. This realization has fuelled
  a growing literature introducing various identifying assumptions, for example in
  the form of a causal diagram among relevant variables. In practice, this paradigm
  is still too rigid for many practical applications as it is generally not possible
  to confidently delineate the true causal diagram. In this paper, we consider the
  derivation of bounds on causal effects given only observational data. We propose
  to take as input a less informative structure known as a Partial Ancestral Graph,
  which represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams and is learnable
  from data. In this more “data-driven” setting, we provide a systematic algorithm
  to derive bounds on causal effects that exploit the invariant properties of the
  equivalence class, and that can be computed analytically. We demonstrate our method
  with synthetic and real data examples.
