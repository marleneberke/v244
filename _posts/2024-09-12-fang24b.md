title: 'Enhancing Patient Recruitment Response in Clinical Trials: an Adaptive Learning
  Framework'
abstract: Patient recruitment remains a key challenge in contemporary clinical trials,
  often leading to trial failures due to insufficient recruitment rates.  To address
  this issue, we introduce a novel adaptive learning framework that integrates machine
  learning methods to facilitate evidence-informed recruitment. Through dynamic testing,
  predictive learning, and adaptive pruning of recruitment plans, the proposed framework
  ensures superiority over the conventional random assignment approach. We discuss
  the practical considerations for implementing this framework and conduct a simulation
  study to assess the overall response rates and chances of improvement. The findings
  suggest that the proposed approach can substantially enhance patient recruitment
  efficiency. By systematically optimizing recruitment plan allocation, this adaptive
  learning framework shows promise in addressing recruitment challenges across broad
  clinical research settings, potentially transforming how patient recruitment is
  managed in clinical trials.
