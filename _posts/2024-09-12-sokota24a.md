title: Computing Low-Entropy Couplings for Large-Support Distributions
abstract: Minimum-entropy coupling (MEC)—the process of finding a joint distribution
  with minimum entropy for given marginals—has applications in areas such as causality
  and steganography. However, existing algorithms are either computationally intractable
  for large-support distributions or limited to specific distribution types and sensitive
  to hyperparameter choices. This work addresses these limitations by unifying a prior
  family of iterative MEC (IMEC) approaches into a generalized partition-based formalism.
  From this framework, we derive a novel IMEC algorithm called ARIMEC, capable of
  handling arbitrary discrete distributions, and introduce a method to make IMEC robust
  to suboptimal hyperparameter settings. These innovations facilitate the application
  of IMEC to high-throughput steganography with language models, among other settings.
