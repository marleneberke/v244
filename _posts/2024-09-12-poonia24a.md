title: "$χ$SPN: Characteristic Interventional Sum-Product Networks for Causal Inference
  in Hybrid Domains"
abstract: Causal inference in hybrid domains, characterized by a mixture of discrete
  and continuous variables, presents a formidable challenge. We take a step towards
  this direction and propose <b>Ch</b>aracteristic <b>I</b>nterventional Sum-Product
  Network ($\chi$SPN) that is capable of estimating interventional distributions in
  presence of random variables drawn from mixed distributions. $\chi$SPN uses characteristic
  functions in the leaves of an interventional SPN (iSPN) thereby providing a unified
  view for discrete and continuous random variables through the Fourier{–}Stieltjes
  transform of the probability measures. A neural network is used to estimate the
  parameters of the learned iSPN using the intervened data. Our experiments on 3 synthetic
  heterogeneous datasets suggest that $\chi$SPN can effectively capture the interventional
  distributions for both discrete and continuous variables while being expressive
  and causally adequate. We also show that $\chi$SPN generalize to multiple interventions
  while being trained only on a single intervention data.
