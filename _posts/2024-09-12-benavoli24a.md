title: 'Linearly Constrained Gaussian Processes are SkewGPs: application to Monotonic
  Preference Learning and Desirability'
abstract: We show that existing approaches to Linearly Constrained Gaussian Processes
  (LCGP) for regression, based on imposing constraints on a finite set of operational
  points, can be seen as Skew Gaussian Processes (SkewGPs). In particular, focusing
  on inequality constraints and building upon a recent unification of regression,
  classification, and preference learning through SkewGPs, we extend LCGP to handle
  monotonic preference learning and desirability, crucial for  understanding and predicting
  human decision making.  We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model on simulated
  and real data.
