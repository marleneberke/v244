title: Probabilities of Causation for Continuous and Vector Variables
abstract: "*Probabilities of causation* (PoC) are valuable concepts for explainable
  artificial intelligence and practical decision-making. PoC are originally defined
  for scalar binary variables. In this paper, we extend the concept of PoC to continuous
  treatment and outcome variables, and further generalize PoC  to capture causal effects
  between multiple treatments and multiple outcomes. In addition, we consider PoC
  for a sub-population and PoC with multi-hypothetical terms to capture more sophisticated
  counterfactual information useful for decision-making. We provide a nonparametric
  identification theorem for each type of PoC we introduce. Finally, we illustrate
  the application of our results on a real-world dataset about education."
