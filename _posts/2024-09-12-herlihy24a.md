title: On Overcoming Miscalibrated Conversational Priors in LLM-based ChatBots
abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Model (LLM-based) chatbots to power
  recommender systems. We observe that the chatbots respond poorly when they encounter
  under-specified requests  (e.g., they make incorrect assumptions, hedge with a long
  response, or refuse to answer). We conjecture that such miscalibrated response tendencies
  (i.e., conversational priors) can be attributed to LLM fine-tuning by annotators
  — single-turn annotations may not capture multi-turn conversation utility, and the
  annotators’ preferences may not even be representative of users interacting with
  a recommender system.  We first analyze public LLM chat logs to conclude that query
  under-specification is common. Next, we study synthetic recommendation problems
  with known but latent item utilities, and frame them as Partially Observed Decision
  Processes (PODP). We find that pre-trained LLMs can be sub-optimal for PODPs and
  derive better policies that clarify under-specified queries when appropriate. Then,
  we re-calibrate LLMs by prompting them with learned control messages to approximate
  the improved policy. Finally, we show empirically that our lightweight learning
  approach effectively uses logged conversation data to re-calibrate the response
  strategies of LLM-based chatbots for recommendation tasks.
