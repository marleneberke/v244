title: Generalized Expected Utility as a Universal Decision Rule – A Step Forward
abstract: In order to capture a larger range of decision rules, this paper extends
  the seminal work of [Friedman and Halpern, 1995, Chu and Halpern, 2003, 2004] about
  Generalized Expected Utility. We introduce the notion of algebraic mass function
  (and of algebraic Möbius transform) and provide a new algebraic expression for expected
  utility based on such functions. This utility, that we call "XEU", generalizes Chu
  and Halpern’s GEU to non-decomposable measures and allows for the representation
  of several rules that could not be captured up to this point, and noticeably, of
  the Choquet integral. A representation theorem is provided that shows that only
  a very weak condition is needed for a rule in order to be representable as a XEU.
