title: Differentially Private No-regret Exploration in Adversarial Markov Decision
  Processes
abstract: We study learning adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) in the episodic
  setting under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). This is motivated by
  the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary and
  even adversarial scenarios, where protecting usersâ€™ sensitive information is vital.
  We first propose two efficient frameworks for adversarial MDPs, spanning full-information
  and bandit settings. Within each framework, we consider both Joint DP (JDP), where
  a central agent is trusted to protect the sensitive data, and Local DP (LDP), where
  the information is protected directly on the user side. Then, we design novel privacy
  mechanisms to privatize the stochastic transition and adversarial losses. By instantiating
  such privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, we obtain near-optimal
  regret guarantees for both frameworks. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms
  to tackle the challenge of private learning in adversarial MDPs.
