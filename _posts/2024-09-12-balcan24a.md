title: Learning Accurate and Interpretable Decision Trees
abstract: Decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning and yield easy-to-understand
  models. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for learning a decision
  tree classifier, with different techniques working well for data from different
  domains. In this work, we develop approaches to design decision tree learning algorithms
  given repeated access to data from the same domain. We propose novel parameterized
  classes of node splitting criteria in top-down algorithms, which interpolate between
  popularly used entropy and Gini impurity based criteria, and provide theoretical
  bounds on the number of samples needed to learn the splitting function appropriate
  for the data at hand. We also study the sample complexity of tuning prior parameters
  in Bayesian decision tree learning, and extend our results to decision tree regression.
  We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision
  tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning. We
  also study the interpretability of the learned decision trees and introduce a data-driven
  approach for optimizing the explainability versus accuracy trade-off using decision
  trees. Finally, we demonstrate the significance of our approach on real world datasets
  by learning data-specific decision trees which are simultaneously more accurate
  and interpretable.
