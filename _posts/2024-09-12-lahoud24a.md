title: 'DataSP: A Differential All-to-All Shortest Path Algorithm for Learning Costs
  and Predicting Paths with Context'
abstract: Learning latent costs of transitions on graphs from trajectories demonstrations
  under various contextual features is challenging but useful for path planning. Yet,
  existing methods either oversimplify cost assumptions or scale poorly with the number
  of observed trajectories. This paper introduces DataSP, a differentiable all-to-all
  shortest path algorithm to facilitate learning latent costs from trajectories. It
  allows to learn from a large number of trajectories in each learning step without
  additional computation. Complex latent cost functions from contextual features can
  be represented in the algorithm through a neural network approximation. We further
  propose a method to sample paths from DataSP in order to reconstruct/mimic observed
  pathsâ€™ distributions. We prove that the inferred distribution follows the maximum
  entropy principle. We show that DataSP outperforms state-of-the-art differentiable
  combinatorial solver and classical machine learning approaches in predicting paths
  on graphs.
