title: A Global Markov Property for Solutions of Stochastic Difference Equations and
  the corresponding Full Time Graphs
abstract: 'Structural Causal Models (SCMs) are an important tool in causal inference.
  They induce a graph and if the graph is acyclic, a unique observational distribution.
  A standard result states that in this acyclic case, the induced observational distribution
  satisfies a d-separation global Markov property relative to the induced graph. Time
  series can also be modelled like SCMs: One just interprets the stochastic difference
  equations that a time series solves as structural equations. However, technical
  problems arise when time series "start" at minus infinity. In particular, a d-separation
  global Markov property for time series and the corresponding infinite graphs, the
  so-called full time graphs, has thus far only been shown for stable vector autoregressive
  processes with independent finite-second-moment noise.  In this paper, we prove
  a much more general version of this Markov property. We discuss our assumptions
  and study violations of them.  Doing so hints at several pitfalls at the intersection
  of time series analysis and causal inference. Moreover, we introduce a new projection
  procedure for these infinite graphs which might be of independent interest.'
