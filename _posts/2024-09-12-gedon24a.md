title: Uncertainty Estimation with Recursive Feature Machines
abstract: In conventional regression analysis, predictions are typically represented
  as point estimates derived from covariates. The Gaussian Process (GP) offer a kernel-based
  framework that predicts and quantifies associated uncertainties. However, kernel-based
  methods often underperform ensemble-based decision tree approaches in regression
  tasks involving tabular and categorical data. Recently, Recursive Feature Machines
  (RFMs) were proposed as a novel feature-learning kernel which strengthens the capabilities
  of kernel machines. In this study, we harness the power of these RFMs in a probabilistic
  GP-based approach to enhance uncertainty estimation through feature extraction within
  kernel methods. We employ this learned kernel for in-depth uncertainty analysis.
  On tabular datasets, our RFM-based method surpasses other leading uncertainty estimation
  techniques, including NGBoost and CatBoost-ensemble. Additionally, when assessing
  out-of-distribution performance, we found that boosting-based methods are surpassed
  by our RFM-based approach.
