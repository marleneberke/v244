title: A Graph Theoretic Approach for Preference Learning with Feature Information
abstract: We consider the problem of ranking a set of $n$ items given a sample of
  their pairwise preferences. It is well known from the classical results of sorting
  literature that without any further assumption, one requires a sample size of $\Omega(n
  \log n)$ with active selection of pairs whereas, for a random set pairwise preferences
  the bound could be as bad as $\Omega(n^2)$. However, what if the learner is exposed
  to additional knowledge of the items features and their pairwise preferences are
  known to be modelled in terms of their feature similarities – can these bounds be
  improved? In particular, we introduce a new probabilistic preference model, called
  feature-Bradley-Terry-Luce (f-BTL) for the purpose, and present a new least squares
  based algorithm, fBTL-LS, which requires a sample complexity much lesser than $O(n\log
  n)$ random pairs to obtain a ‘good’ ranking. The sample complexity of our proposed
  algorithms depends on the degree of feature correlation of the items that makes
  use of tools from classical graph matching theory, shedding light on the true complexity
  of the problem – this was not possible before with existing matrix completion based
  tools.  We also prove tightness of our results showing a matching information theoretic
  lower bound for the problem. Our theoretical results are corroborated with extensive
  experimental evaluations on varying datasets.
