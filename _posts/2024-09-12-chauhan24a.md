title: Generalization and Learnability in Multiple Instance Regression
abstract: 'Multiple instance regression (MIR) was introduced by Ray and Page (2001)
  as an analogue of multiple instance learning (MIL) in which we are given bags of
  feature-vectors (instances) and for each bag there is a bag-label which matches
  the label of one (unknown) primary instance from that bag. The goal is to compute
  a hypothesis regressor consistent with the underlying instance-labels. A natural
  approach  is to find the best primary instance assignment and regressor optimizing
  the mse loss on the bags though no formal generalization guarantees were known.
  Our work is the first to prove generalization error bounds for MIR when the bags
  are drawn i.i.d. at random. Essentially, with high probability any MIR regressor
  with low error on sampled bags also has low error on the underlying instance-label
  distribution. We next study the complexity of linear regression on MIR bags, shown
  to be NP-hard in general by Ray and Page (2001), who however left open the possibility
  of arbitrarily good approximations. Significantly strengthening previous work, we
  prove a strong inapproximability bound: even if there exists zero bag-loss MIR linear
  regressor on a collection of $2$-sized bags with labels in $[-1,1]$, it is NP-hard
  to find an MIR linear regressor with bag-loss  $< C$ for some absolute constant
  $C > 0$. Our work also proposes a model training method for MIR based on a novel
  weighted assignment loss, geared towards handling overlapping bags which have not
  received much attention previously.  We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic
  and real-world datasets showing that our method outperforms the baseline MIR methods.'
