title: 'Equilibrium Computation in Multidimensional Congestion Games: CSP and Learning
  Dynamics Approaches'
abstract: We present algorithms of two flavors{—}one rooted in constraint satisfaction
  problems (CSPs) and the other in learning dynamics{—}to compute pure-strategy Nash
  equilibrium (PSNE) in k-dimensional congestion games (k-DCGs) and their variants.
  The two algorithmic approaches are driven by whether or not a PSNE is guaranteed
  to exist. We first show that deciding the existence of a PSNE in a k-DCG is NP-complete
  even when players have binary and unit demand vectors. For general cost functions
  (potentially non-monotonic), we devise a new CSP-inspired algorithmic framework
  for PSNE computation, leading to algorithms that run in polynomial time under certain
  assumptions while offering exponential savings over standard CSP algorithms. We
  further refine these algorithms for variants of k-DCGs. Our experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of this new CSP framework for hard, non-monotonic k-DCGs. We then
  provide learning dynamics-based PSNE computation algorithms for linear and exponential
  cost functions. These algorithms run in polynomial time under certain assumptions.
  For general cost, we give a learning dynamics algorithm for an (\ensuremath{(\alpha,
  \beta)})-approximate PSNE (for certain \ensuremath{\alpha} and \ensuremath{\beta}).
  Lastly, we also devise polynomial-time algorithms for structured demands and cost
  functions.
