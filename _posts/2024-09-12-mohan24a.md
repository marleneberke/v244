title: Evaluating Bayesian deep learning for radio galaxy classification
abstract: 'The radio astronomy community is rapidly adopting deep learning techniques
  to deal with the huge data volumes expected from the next generation of radio observatories.
  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a principled way to model uncertainty in
  the predictions made by such deep learning models and will play an important role
  in extracting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on their outputs. In this work,
  we evaluate the performance of different BNNs against the following criteria: predictive
  performance, uncertainty calibration and distribution-shift detection for the radio
  galaxy classification problem.'
