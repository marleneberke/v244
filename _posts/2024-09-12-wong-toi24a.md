title: Understanding Pathologies of Deep Heteroskedastic Regression
abstract: Deep, overparameterized regression models are notorious for their tendency
  to overfit. This problem is exacerbated in heteroskedastic models, which predict
  both mean and residual noise for each data point. At one extreme, these models fit
  all training data perfectly, eliminating residual noise entirely; at the other,
  they overfit the residual noise while predicting a constant, uninformative mean.
  We observe a lack of middle ground, suggesting a phase transition dependent on model
  regularization strength. Empirical verification supports this conjecture by fitting
  numerous models with varying mean and variance regularization. To explain the transition,
  we develop a theoretical framework based on a statistical field theory, yielding
  qualitative agreement with experiments. As a practical consequence, our analysis
  simplifies hyperparameter tuning from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional search,
  substantially reducing the computational burden. Experiments on diverse datasets,
  including UCI datasets and the large-scale ClimSim climate dataset, demonstrate
  significantly improved performance in various calibration tasks.
