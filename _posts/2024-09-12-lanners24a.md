title: Common Event Tethering to Improve Prediction of Rare Clinical Events
abstract: 'Learning to predict rare medical events is difficult due to the inherent
  lack of signal in highly imbalanced datasets. Yet, oftentimes we also have access
  to surrogate or related outcomes that we believe share etiology or underlying risk
  factors with the event of interest. In this work, we propose the use of two variants
  of a well-known approach, regularized multi-label learning (MLL), that we hypothesize
  are uniquely suited to leverage this similarity and improve model performance in
  rare event settings. Whereas most analyses of MLL emphasize improved performance
  across all event types, our analyses quantify benefits to rare event prediction
  offered by our approach when a more common, related event is available to enhance
  learning. We begin by deriving asymptotic properties and providing theoretical insight
  into the convergence rates of our proposed estimators. We then provide simulation
  results highlighting how characteristics of the data generating process, including
  the event similarity and event rate, affect our proposed modelsâ€™ performance. We
  conclude by showing real-world benefit of our approach in two clinical settings:
  prediction of rare cardiovascular morbidities in the setting of preeclampsia; and
  early prediction of autism from the electronic health record.'
