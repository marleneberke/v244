title: Hidden Population Estimation with Indirect Inference and Auxiliary Information
abstract: Many populations defined by illegal or stigmatized behavior are difficult
  to sample using conventional survey methodology. Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS)
  is a participant referral process frequently employed in this context to collect
  information. This sampling methodology can be modeled as a stochastic process that
  explores the graph of a social network, generating a partially observed subgraph
  between study participants. The methods currently used to impute the missing edges
  in this subgraph exhibit biased downstream estimation. We leverage auxiliary participant
  information and concepts from indirect inference to ameliorate these issues and
  improve estimation of the hidden population size. These advances result in smaller
  bias and higher precision in the estimation of the study participant arrival rate,
  the sample subgraph, and the population size. Lastly, we use our method to estimate
  the number of People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) in the Kohtla-Jarve region of Estonia.
