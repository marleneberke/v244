title: Causally Abstracted Multi-armed Bandits
abstract: Multi-armed bandits (MAB) and causal MABs (CMAB) are established frameworks
  for decision-making problems. The majority of prior work typically studies and solves
  individual MAB and CMAB in isolation for a given problem and associated data. However,
  decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations
  where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem
  structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for CMABs addresses the situation
  where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may
  differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving CMABs defined
  on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related
  via an abstraction map. Formally, we introduce the problem of causally abstracted
  MABs (CAMABs) by relying on the theory of causal abstraction in order to express
  a rigorous abstraction map. We propose algorithms to learn in a CAMAB, and study
  their regret. We illustrate the limitations and the strengths of our algorithms
  on a real-world scenario related to online advertising.
