title: Linear Opinion Pooling for Uncertainty Quantification on Graphs
abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification for graph-structured
  data, or, more specifically, the problem to quantify the predictive uncertainty
  in (semi-supervised) node classification. Key questions in this regard concern the
  distinction  between two different types of uncertainty, aleatoric and epistemic,
  and how to support uncertainty quantification by leveraging the structural information
  provided by the graph topology. Challenging assumptions and postulates of state-of-the-art
  methods, we propose a novel approach that represents (epistemic) uncertainty in
  terms of mixtures of Dirichlet distributions and refers to the established principle
  of linear opinion pooling for propagating information between neighbored nodes in
  the graph. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in a series of experiments
  on a variety of graph-structured datasets.
