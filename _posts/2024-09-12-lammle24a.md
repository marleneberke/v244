title: Quantifying Local Model Validity using Active Learning
abstract: Real-world applications of machine learning models are often subject to
  legal or policy-based regulations. Some of these regulations require ensuring the
  validity of the model, i.e., the approximation error being smaller than a threshold.
  A global metric is generally too insensitive to determine the validity of a specific
  prediction, whereas evaluating local validity is costly since it requires gathering
  additional data. We propose learning the model error to acquire a local validity
  estimate while reducing the amount of required data through active learning. Using
  model validation benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed method
  can lead to an error model with sufficient discriminative properties using a relatively
  small amount of data. Furthermore, an increased sensitivity to local changes of
  the validity bounds compared to alternative approaches is demonstrated.
