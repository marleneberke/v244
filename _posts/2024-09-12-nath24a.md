title: Neural Architecture Search Finds Robust Models by Knowledge Distillation
abstract: Despite their superior performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often
  vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for
  automatically designing the architectures of DNNs, has shown remarkable performance
  across various machine learning applications. However, the adversarial robustness
  of architectures learned by NAS against adversarial threats remains under-explored.
  By integrating a robust teacher, we examine whether NAS can yield a robust neural
  architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose
  Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL),
  a novel NAS algorithm that enhances the robustness of architectures learned by NAS
  through employing cross-layer knowledge distillation from a robust teacher. Distinct
  from previous knowledge distillation approaches that only align student-teacher
  outputs at the final layer, RNAS-CL dynamically searches for the optimal teacher
  layer to guide each student layer. Our experimental findings validate the effectiveness
  of RNAS-CL, demonstrating that it can generate both compact and adversarially robust
  neural architectures. Our results pave the way for developing new strategies for
  compact and robust neural architecture design applicable across various fields.
  The code of RNAS-CL is available at \url{https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/RNAS-CL}.
