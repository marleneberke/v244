title: Investigating the Impact of Model Width and Density on Generalization in Presence
  of Label Noise
abstract: Increasing the size of overparameterized neural networks has been a key
  in achieving state-of-the-art performance. This is captured by the double descent
  phenomenon, where the test loss follows a decreasing-increasing-decreasing pattern
  (or sometimes monotonically decreasing) as model width increases. However, the effect
  of label noise on the test loss curve has not been fully explored. In this work,
  we uncover an intriguing phenomenon where label noise leads to a <em>final ascent</em>
  in the originally observed double descent curve. Specifically, under a sufficiently
  large noise-to-sample-size ratio, optimal generalization is achieved at intermediate
  widths. Through theoretical analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to the shape
  transition of test loss variance induced by label noise. Furthermore, we extend
  the final ascent phenomenon to model density and provide the first theoretical characterization
  showing that reducing density by randomly dropping trainable parameters improves
  generalization under label noise. We also thoroughly examine the roles of regularization
  and sample size. Surprisingly, we find that larger $\ell_2$ regularization and robust
  learning methods against label noise exacerbate the final ascent. We confirm the
  validity of our findings through extensive experiments on ReLu networks trained
  on MNIST, ResNets/ViT trained on CIFAR-10/100, and InceptionResNet-v2 trained on
  Stanford Cars with real-world noisy labels.
