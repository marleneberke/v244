title: Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability
  Objectives
abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models
  for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This
  paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon)
  Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the
  probability of reaching some target states.  This is also a core problem in model
  checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor
  is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted
  problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based
  heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages
  the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space
  (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling
  loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided
  bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal
  policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite
  of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all
  cases in both probability guarantees and computation time.
