title: 'Pix2Code: Learning to Compose Neural Visual Concepts as Programs'
abstract: The challenge in learning abstract concepts from images in an unsupervised
  fashion lies in the required integration of visual perception and generalizable
  relational reasoning. Moreover, the unsupervised nature of this task makes it necessary
  for human users to be able to understand a model’s learned concepts and potentially
  revise false behaviors. To tackle both the generalizability and interpretability
  constraints of visual concept learning, we propose Pix2Code, a framework that extends
  program synthesis to visual relational reasoning by utilizing the abilities of both
  explicit, compositional symbolic and implicit neural representations. This is achieved
  by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts
  as $\lambda$-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on
  the challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns, and CURI, testing its ability
  to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept
  configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that
  Pix2Code’s representations remain human interpretable and can easily be revised
  for improved performance.
