title: Decentralized Two-Sided Bandit Learning in Matching Market
abstract: Two-sided matching under uncertainty has recently drawn much attention due
  to its wide applications.  Existing works in matching bandits mainly focus on the
  one-sided learning setting and design algorithms with the objective of converging
  to stable matching with low regret.  In this paper, we consider the more general
  two-sided learning setting, i.e. participants on both sides have to learn their
  preferences over the other side through repeated interactions.  Inspired by the
  classical result that the optimal matching for the proposing side can be obtained
  using the Gale-Shapley algorithm, our inquiry stems from the curiosity about whether
  this result still holds in a two-sided learning setting. To handle this question,
  we formally introduce the two-sided learning setting, addressing strategies for
  both the arm and player sides without restrictive assumptions such as special preference
  structure and observation of winning players.  Our results not only provide a positive
  answer to our inquiry but also offer a near-optimal upper bound, achieving $O(\log
  T)$ regret.
