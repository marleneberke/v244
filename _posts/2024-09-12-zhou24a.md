title: Approximate Kernel Density Estimation under Metric-based Local Differential
  Privacy
abstract: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a fundamental problem with broad machine
  learning applications. In this paper, we investigate the KDE problem under Local
  Differential Privacy (LDP), a setting in which users privatize data on their own
  devices before sending them to an untrusted server for analytics. To strike a balance
  between ensuring local privacy and preserving high-utility KDE results, we adopt
  a relaxed definition of LDP based on metrics (mLDP), which is suitable when data
  points are represented in a metric space and can be more distinguishable as their
  distances increase. To the best of our knowledge, approximate KDE under mLDP has
  not been explored in the existing literature. We propose the mLDP-KDE framework,
  which augments a locality-sensitive hashing-based sketch method to provide mLDP
  and answer any KDE query unbiasedly within an additive error with high probability
  in sublinear time and space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
  mLDP-KDE framework outperforms several existing KDE methods under LDP and mLDP by
  achieving significantly better trade-offs between privacy and utility, with particularly
  remarkable advantages on large, high-dimensional data.
