title: Decentralized Online Learning in General-Sum Stackelberg Games
abstract: 'We study an online learning problem in general-sum Stackelberg games, where
  players act in a decentralized and strategic manner. We study two settings depending
  on the type of information for the follower: (1) the <em>limited information</em>
  setting where the follower only observes its own reward, and (2) the <em>side information</em>
  setting where the follower has extra side information about the leader’s reward.
  We show that for the follower, myopically best responding to the leader’s action
  is the best strategy for the limited information setting, but not necessarily so
  for the side information setting – the follower can manipulate the leader’s reward
  signals with strategic actions, and hence induce the leader’s strategy to converge
  to an equilibrium that is better off for itself. Based on these insights, we study
  decentralized online learning for both players in the two settings. Our main contribution
  is to derive <em>last iterate</em> convergence and sample complexity results in
  both settings. Notably, we design a new manipulation strategy for the follower in
  the latter setting, and show that it has an intrinsic advantage against the best
  response strategy. Our theories are also supported by empirical results.'
