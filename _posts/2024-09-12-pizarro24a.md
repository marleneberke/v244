title: 'DistriBlock: Identifying adversarial audio samples by leveraging characteristics
  of the output distribution'
abstract: 'Adversarial attacks can mislead automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems
  into predicting an arbitrary target text, thus posing a clear security threat. To
  prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable
  to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in
  each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median,
  maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution,
  as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to
  the distributions of the subsequent time step.  Then, by leveraging the characteristics
  observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including
  simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural
  networks.  Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems
  and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach,
  with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing
  target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively.  To
  assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples
  that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect
  through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system’s robustness.ics
