title: Last-iterate Convergence Separation between Extra-gradient and Optimism in
  Constrained Periodic Games
abstract: Last-iterate behaviors of learning algorithms in repeated two-player zero-sum
  games have been extensively studied due to their wide applications in machine learning
  and related tasks. Typical algorithms that exhibit the last-iterate convergence
  property include optimistic and extra-gradient methods. However, most existing results
  establish these properties under the assumption that the game is time-independent.
  Recently, (Feng et al., 2023) studied the last-iterate behaviors of optimistic and
  extra-gradient methods in games with a time-varying payoff matrix, and proved that
  in an unconstrained periodic game, extra-gradient method  converges to the equilibrium
  while optimistic method diverges. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom
  that these two methods are expected to behave similarly as they do in time-independent
  games. However, compared to unconstrained games, games with constrains are more
  common both in practical and theoretical studies. In this paper, we investigate
  the last-iterate behaviors of optimistic and extra-gradient methods in the constrained
  periodic games, demonstrating that similar separation results for last-iterate convergence
  also hold in this setting.
