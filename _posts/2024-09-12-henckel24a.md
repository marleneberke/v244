title: 'Adjustment Identification Distance: A gadjid for Causal Structure Learning'
abstract: 'Evaluating graphs learned by causal discovery algorithms is difficult:
  The number of edges that differ between two graphs does not reflect how the graphs
  differ with respect to the identifying formulas they suggest for causal effects.
  We introduce a framework for developing causal distances between graphs which includes
  the structural intervention distance for directed acyclic graphs as a special case.
  We use this framework to develop improved adjustment-based distances as well as
  extensions to completed partially directed acyclic graphs and causal orders. We
  develop new reachability algorithms to compute the distances efficiently and to
  prove their low polynomial time complexity. In our package gadjid (open source at
  https://github.com/CausalDisco/gadjid), we provide implementations of our distances;
  they are orders of magnitude faster with proven lower time complexity than the structural
  intervention distance and thereby provide a success metric for causal discovery
  that scales to graph sizes that were previously prohibitive.'
