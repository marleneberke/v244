title: 'Zero Inflation as a Missing Data Problem: a Proxy-based Approach'
abstract: A common type of zero-inflated data has certain true values incorrectly
  replaced by zeros due to data recording conventions (rare outcomes assumed to be
  absent) or details of data recording equipment (e.g. artificial zeros in gene expression
  data). Existing methods for zero-inflated data either fit the observed data likelihood
  via parametric mixture models that explicitly represent excess zeros, or aim to
  replace excess zeros by imputed values.  If the goal of the analysis relies on knowing
  true data realizations, a particular challenge with zero-inflated data is identifiability,
  since it is difficult to correctly determine which observed zeros are real and which
  are inflated. This paper views zero-inflated data as a general type of missing data
  problem, where the observability indicator for a potentially censored variable is
  itself unobserved whenever a zero is recorded. We show that, without additional
  assumptions, target parameters involving a zero-inflated variable are not identified.
  However, if a proxy of the missingness indicator is observed, a modification of
  the effect restoration approach of Kuroki and Pearl allows identification and estimation,
  given the proxy-indicator relationship is known. If this relationship is unknown,
  our approach yields a partial identification strategy for sensitivity analysis.
  Specifically, we show that only certain proxy-indicator relationships are compatible
  with the observed data distribution. We give an analytic bound for this relationship
  in cases with a categorical outcome, which is sharp in certain models. For more
  complex cases, sharp numerical bounds may be computed using methods in Duarte et
  al. [2023]. We illustrate our method via simulation studies and a data application
  on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
