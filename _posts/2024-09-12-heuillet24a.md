title: Neural Active Learning Meets the Partial Monitoring Framework
abstract: We focus on the online-based active learning (OAL) setting where an agent
  operates over a stream of observations and trades-off between the costly acquisition
  of information (labelled observations) and the cost of prediction errors. We propose
  a novel foundation for OAL tasks based on partial monitoring, a theoretical framework
  specialized in online learning from partially informative actions.  We show that
  previously studied binary and multi-class OAL tasks are instances of partial monitoring.
  We expand the real-world potential of OAL by introducing a new class of cost-sensitive
  OAL tasks. We propose NeuralCBP, the first PM strategy that accounts for predictive
  uncertainty with deep neural networks. Our extensive empirical evaluation on open
  source datasets shows that NeuralCBP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art
  baselines on multiple binary, multi-class and cost-sensitive OAL tasks.
