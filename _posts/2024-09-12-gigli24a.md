title: 'Bootstrap Your Conversions: Thompson Sampling for Partially Observable Delayed
  Rewards'
abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address contextual bandit problems
  with partially observable, delayed feedback by introducing an approximate Thompson
  sampling technique. This is a common setting, with applications ranging from online
  marketing to vaccine trials. Leveraging Bootstrapped Thompson sampling (BTS), we
  obtain an approximate posterior distribution over delay distributions and conversion
  probabilities, thereby extending an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) model to the Bayesian
  domain. Unlike prior methodologies, our approach does not overlook uncertainty on
  delays. Within the EM framework, we employ the Kaplan-Meier estimator to place no
  restriction on delay distributions. Through extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
  techniques, our approach demonstrates superior performance across the majority of
  tested environments, with comparable performance in the remaining cases. Furthermore,
  our method offers practical implementation using off-the-shelf libraries, facilitating
  broader adoption. Our technique lays a foundation for extending to other bandit
  settings, such as non-contextual bandits or action-dependent delay distributions,
  promising wider applicability and versatility in real-world applications.
