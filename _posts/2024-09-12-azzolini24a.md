title: Inference in Probabilistic Answer Set Programs with Imprecise Probabilities
  via Optimization
abstract: Probabilistic answer set programming has recently been extended to manage
  imprecise probabilities by means of credal probabilistic facts and credal annotated
  disjunctions. This increases the expressivity of the language but, at the same time,
  the cost of inference. In this paper, we cast inference in probabilistic answer
  set programs with credal probabilistic facts and credal annotated disjunctions as
  a constrained nonlinear optimization problem where the function to optimize is obtained
  via knowledge compilation. Empirical results on different datasets with multiple
  configurations shows the effectiveness of our approach.
