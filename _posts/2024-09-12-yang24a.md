title: Graph Contrastive Learning under Heterophily via Graph Filters
abstract: Graph contrastive learning (CL) methods learn node representations in a
  self-supervised manner by maximizing the similarity between the augmented node representations
  obtained via a GNN-based encoder. However, CL methods perform poorly on graphs with
  heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes. In this
  work, we address this problem by proposing an effective graph CL method, namely
  HLCL, for learning graph representations under heterophily. HLCL first identifies
  a homophilic and a heterophilic subgraph based on the cosine similarity of node
  features. It then uses a low-pass and a high-pass graph filter to aggregate representations
  of nodes connected in the homophilic subgraph and differentiate representations
  of nodes in the heterophilic subgraph. The final node representations are learned
  by contrasting both the augmented high-pass filtered views and the augmented low-pass
  filtered node views. Our extensive experiments show that HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art
  graph CL methods on benchmark datasets with heterophily, as well as large-scale
  real-world graphs, by up to 7%, and outperforms graph supervised learning methods
  on datasets with heterophily by up to 10%.
