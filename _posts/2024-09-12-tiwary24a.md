title: Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets via Contrastive Divergence
abstract: Bayesian methods provide an elegant framework for estimating parameter posteriors
  and quantification of uncertainty associated with probabilistic models. However,
  they often suffer from slow inference times. To address this challenge, Bayesian
  Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) have emerged as a promising solution. BPC methods aim to create
  a small synthetic dataset, known as pseudo-coresets, that approximates the posterior
  inference achieved with the original dataset. This approximation is achieved by
  optimizing a divergence measure between the true posterior and the pseudo-coreset
  posterior. Various divergence measures have been proposed for constructing pseudo-coresets,
  with forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence being the most successful. However,
  using forward KL divergence necessitates sampling from the pseudo-coreset posterior,
  often accomplished through approximate Gaussian variational distributions. Alternatively,
  one could employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling, but this
  becomes challenging in high-dimensional parameter spaces due to slow mixing. In
  this study, we introduce a novel approach for constructing pseudo-coresets by utilizing
  contrastive divergence. Importantly, optimizing contrastive divergence eliminates
  the need for approximations in the pseudo-coreset construction process. Furthermore,
  it enables the use of finite-step MCMC methods, alleviating the requirement for
  extensive mixing to reach a stationary distribution. To validate our methodâ€™s effectiveness,
  we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating its superiority
  over existing BPC techniques.  Our implementation is available at https://github.com/backpropagator/BPC-CD
