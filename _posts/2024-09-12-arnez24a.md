title: Latent Representation Entropy Density for Distribution Shift Detection
abstract: Distribution shift detection is paramount in safety-critical tasks that
  rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The detection task entails deriving a confidence
  score to assert whether a new input sample aligns with the training data distribution
  of the DNN model. While DNN predictive uncertainty offers an intuitive confidence
  measure, exploring uncertainty-based distribution shift detection with simple sample-based
  techniques has been relatively overlooked in recent years due to computational overhead
  and lower performance than plain post-hoc methods. This paper proposes using simple
  sample-based techniques for estimating uncertainty and employing the entropy density
  from intermediate representations to detect distribution shifts. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method using standard benchmark datasets for out-of-distribution
  detection and across different common perception tasks with convolutional neural
  network architectures. Our scope extends beyond classification, encompassing image-level
  distribution shift detection for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.
  Our results show that our method’s performance is comparable to existing <em>State-of-the-Art</em>
  methods while being computationally faster and lighter than other Bayesian approaches,
  affirming its practical utility.
