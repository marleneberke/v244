title: Active Learning Framework for Incomplete Networks
abstract: Significant progression has been made in active learning algorithms for
  graph networks in various tasks. However real-world applications frequently involve
  incomplete graphs with missing links, which pose the challenge that existing approaches
  might not adequately address. This paper presents an active learning approach tailored
  specifically for handling incomplete graphs, termed ALIN. Our algorithm employs
  graph neural networks (GNN) to generate node embeddings and calculates losses for
  both node classification and link prediction tasks. The losses are combined with
  appropriate weights and iteratively updating the GNN, ALIN efficiently queries nodes
  in batches, thereby achieving a balance between training feedbacks and resource
  utilization. Our empirical experiments have shown ALIN can surpass state-of-the-art
  baselines on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Coauthor-CS datasets.
