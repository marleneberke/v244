title: Approximation Algorithms for Observer Aware MDPs
abstract: We present approximation algorithms for Observer-Aware Markov Decision Processes
  (OAMDPs). OAMDPs model sequential decision-making problems in which rewards depend
  on the beliefs of an observer about the goals, intentions, or capabilities of the
  observed agent. The first proposed algorithm is a grid-based value iteration (Grid-VI),
  which discretizes the observerâ€™s belief into regular grids. Based on the same discretization,
  the second proposed algorithm is a variant of Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP)
  called Grid-RTDP. Unlike Grid-Vi, Grid-RTDP focuses its updates on promising states
  using heuristic estimates.  We provide theoretical guarantees of the proposed algorithms
  and demonstrate that Grid-RTDP has a good anytime performance comparable to the
  existing approach without performance guarantees.
