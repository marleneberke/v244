title: Products, Abstractions and Inclusions of Causal Spaces
abstract: Causal spaces have recently been introduced as a measure-theoretic framework
  to encode the notion of causality. While it has some advantages over established
  frameworks, such as structural causal models, the theory is so far only developed
  for single causal spaces. In many mathematical theories, not least the theory of
  probability spaces of which causal spaces are a direct extension, combinations of
  objects and maps between objects form a central part. In this paper, taking inspiration
  from such objects in probability theory, we propose the definitions of products
  of causal spaces, as well as (stochastic) transformations between causal spaces.
  In the context of causality, these quantities can be given direct semantic interpretations
  as causally independent components, abstractions and extensions.
