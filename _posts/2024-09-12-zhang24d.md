title: Neighbor Similarity and Multimodal Alignment based Product Recommendation Study
abstract: Existing multimodal recommendation research still faces some challenges,
  such as not being able to fully mine the implicit relevance information of neighbor
  nodes, and the unreasonable weight allocation to imbalanced nodes. To address the
  aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces a new multimodal recommendation
  model called NSMAR+. Specifically, the model firstly constructs a neighbor similarity
  graph convolutional network to capture the implicit relevance information and reasonably
  assigns the attention weights through the graph attention mechanism. Secondly, the
  model introduces a modal alignment and fusion mechanism by using a multilayer perceptron
  (MLP) to map image and text features into a shared space for comparison and fusion.
  In addition, the model constructs a user co-interaction graph and an item semantic
  graph based on the original information and performs graph convolution operations
  to enhance the preference information of users and items, and to better capture
  the interactions and internal features between users and items. Finally, MLP is
  employed to aggregate user and item representations and predict personalized recommendation
  rankings. To validate the experimentâ€™s efficacy, this paper compares with several
  leading multimodal recommendation models on public datasets with a performance improvement
  of 1% to 3%. The experimental outcomes indicate that the model in this paper has
  good superiority and accuracy in multimodal recommendation tasks.
