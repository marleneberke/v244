title: Efficiently Deciding Algebraic Equivalence of Bow-Free Acyclic Path Diagrams
abstract: For causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders, constraints
  beyond conditional independences exist that can enable causal discovery algorithms
  to distinguish more pairs of graphs. Such constraints are not well-understood yet.
  In the setting of linear structural equation models without bows, we study algebraic
  constraints and argue that these provide the most fine-grained resolution achievable.
  We propose efficient algorithms that decide whether two graphs impose the same algebraic
  constraints, or whether the constraints imposed by one graph are a subset of those
  imposed by another graph.
