title: 'GeONet: a neural operator for learning the Wasserstein geodesic'
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) offers a versatile framework to compare complex data
  distributions in a geometrically meaningful way. Traditional methods for computing
  the Wasserstein distance and geodesic between probability measures require mesh-specific
  domain discretization and suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. We present GeONet,
  a mesh-invariant deep neural operator network that learns the non-linear mapping
  from the input pair of initial and terminal distributions to the Wasserstein geodesic
  connecting the two endpoint distributions. In the offline training stage, GeONet
  learns the saddle point optimality conditions for the dynamic formulation of the
  OT problem in the primal and dual spaces that are characterized by a coupled PDE
  system. The subsequent inference stage is instantaneous and can be deployed for
  real-time predictions in the online learning setting. We demonstrate that GeONet
  achieves comparable testing accuracy to the standard OT solvers on simulation examples
  and the MNIST dataset with considerably reduced inference-stage computational cost
  by orders of magnitude.
