title: Exploring High-dimensional Search Space via Voronoi Graph Traversing
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a well-established methodology for optimizing
  costly black-box functions. However, the sparse observations in the high-dimensional
  search space pose challenges in constructing reliable Gaussian Process (GP) models,
  which leads to blind exploration of the search space. We propose a novel Voronoi
  Graph Traversing (VGT) algorithm to extend BO to ultra high-dimensional problems.
  VGT employs a Voronoi diagram to mesh the design space and transform it into an
  undirected Voronoi graph. VGT explores the search space by iteratively performing
  path selection, promising cell sampling, and graph expansion operations. We introduce
  a UCB-based global traversal strategy to select the path towards promising Voronoi
  cells. Then we perform local BO within the promising cell and train local GP with
  a neighboring subset. The intrinsic geometric boundaries and adjacency of the Voronoi
  graph assist in fine-tuning the trajectory of local BO sampling. We also present
  a subspace enhancement approach for the intrinsic low-dimensional problems. Experimental
  results, including both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, demonstrate
  the proposed approachâ€™s state-of-the-art performance for tackling ultra high-dimensional
  problems ranging from hundreds to one thousand dimensions.
