title: Can we Defend Against the Unknown? An Empirical Study About Threshold Selection
  for Neural Network Monitoring
abstract: 'With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime
  monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various
  techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability
  between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these
  approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area
  under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications,
  an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these
  scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold
  optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon
  this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors
  the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed
  to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present
  rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness
  of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold
  adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization
  scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.'
