title: Robust Entropy Search for Safe Efficient Bayesian Optimization
abstract: 'The practical use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in engineering applications
  imposes special requirements: high sampling efficiency on the one hand and finding
  a robust solution on the other hand. We address the case of adversarial robustness,
  where all parameters are controllable during the optimization process, but a subset
  of them is uncontrollable or even adversely perturbed at the time of application.
  To this end, we develop an efficient information-based acquisition function that
  we call Robust Entropy Search (RES). We empirically demonstrate its benefits in
  experiments on synthetic and real-life data. The results show that RES reliably
  finds robust optima, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.'
