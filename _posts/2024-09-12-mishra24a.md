title: Characterising Interventions in Causal Games
abstract: Causal games are probabilistic graphical models that enable causal queries
  to be answered in multi-agent settings. They extend causal Bayesian networks by
  specifying decision and utility variables to represent the agentsâ€™ degrees of freedom
  and objectives. In multi-agent settings, whether each agent decides on their policy
  before or after knowing the causal intervention is important as this affects whether
  they can respond to the intervention by adapting their policy. Consequently, previous
  work in causal games imposed chronological constraints on permissible interventions.
  We relax this by outlining a sound and complete set of primitive causal interventions
  so the effect of any arbitrarily complex interventional query can be studied in
  multi-agent settings. We also demonstrate applications to the design of safe AI
  systems by considering causal mechanism design and commitment.
