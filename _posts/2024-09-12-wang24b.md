title: 'Two Facets of SDE Under an Information-Theoretic Lens: Generalization of SGD
  via Training Trajectories and via Terminal States'
abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been shown recently to characterize
  well the dynamics of training machine learning models with SGD. When the generalization
  error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it
  provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour
  of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient
  descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization
  bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly,
  assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE
  and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al.
  [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds
  have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in
  Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate
  comparable to stability-based bounds.
