title: Identification and Estimation of Conditional Average Partial Causal Effects
  via Instrumental Variable
abstract: 'There has been considerable recent interest in estimating heterogeneous
  causal effects. In this paper, we study conditional average partial causal effects
  (CAPCE) to reveal the heterogeneity of causal effects with continuous treatment.
  We provide conditions for identifying CAPCE in an instrumental variable setting.
  Notably, CAPCE is identifiable under a weaker assumption than required by a commonly
  used measure for estimating heterogeneous causal effects of continuous treatment.
  We develop three families of CAPCE estimators: sieve, parametric, and reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based, and analyze their statistical properties. We
  illustrate the proposed CAPCE estimators on synthetic and real-world data.'
