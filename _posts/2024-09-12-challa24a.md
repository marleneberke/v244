title: 'QuantProb: Generalizing Probabilities along with Predictions for a Pre-trained
  Classifier'
abstract: Quantification of Uncertainty in predictions is a challenging problem. In
  the classification settings, although deep learning based models generalize well,
  class probabilities often lack reliability. Calibration errors are used to quantify
  uncertainty, and several methods exist to minimize calibration error. We argue that
  between the choice of having a minimum calibration error on original distribution
  which increases across distortions or having a (possibly slightly higher) calibration
  error which is constant across distortions, we prefer the latter We hypothesize
  that the reason for unreliability of deep networks is - The way neural networks
  are currently trained, the probabilities do not generalize across small distortions.
  We observe that quantile based approaches can potentially solve this problem. We
  propose an innovative approach to decouple the construction of quantile representations
  from the loss function allowing us to compute quantile based probabilities without
  disturbing the original network. We achieve this by establishing a novel duality
  property between quantiles and probabilities, and an ability to obtain quantile
  probabilities from any pre-trained classifier. While post-hoc calibration techniques
  successfully minimize calibration errors, they do not preserve robustness to distortions.
  We show that, Quantile probabilities (QuantProb), obtained from Quantile representations,
  preserve the calibration errors across distortions, since quantile probabilities
  generalize better than the naive Softmax probabilities.
