title: Power Mean Estimation in Stochastic Monte-Carlo Tree Search
abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a widely-used online planning strategy
  that effectively combines Monte-Carlo sampling with forward tree search to make
  optimal decisions in various real-world scenarios. Its success hinges on the application
  of the Upper Confidence bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm, an extension of the Upper
  Confidence bound (UCB) method used in multi-arm bandits. However, theoretical investigations
  of UCT have been found incomplete due to an error in the estimated "logarithmic"
  bonus term used for action selection in the tree. This issue was addressed by introducing
  a "polynomial" exploration bonus, which effectively balances the exploration-exploitation
  trade-off. However, most theoretical studies have focused on deterministic Markov
  Decision Processes (MDPs), neglecting stochastic settings. In this paper, we introduce
  Stochastic-Power-UCT, an MCTS algorithm explicitly designed for stochastic MDPs
  using power mean as the value estimator. We conduct a comprehensive study of the
  polynomial convergence assurance for selecting the optimal action and estimating
  the value at the root node within our methodology. Our findings demonstrate that
  Stochastic-Power-UCT shares the same convergence rate as UCT, with UCT being a special
  case of Stochastic-Power-UCT. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical results through
  empirical assessments across diverse stochastic MDP environments, providing empirical
  evidence to support our methodâ€™s theoretical claims
