title: Learning Distributionally Robust Tractable Probabilistic Models in Continuous
  Domains
abstract: Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) have attracted substantial research
  interest in recent years, particularly because of their ability to answer various
  reasoning queries in polynomial time. In this study, we focus on the distributionally
  robust learning of continuous TPMs and address the challenge of distribution shift
  at test time by tackling the adversarial risk minimization problem within the framework
  of distributionally robust learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that the adversarial
  risk minimization problem can be efficiently addressed when the model permits exact
  log-likelihood evaluation and efficient learning on weighted data. Our experimental
  results on several real-world datasets show that our approach achieves significantly
  higher log-likelihoods on adversarial test sets. Remarkably, we note that the model
  learned via distributionally robust learning can achieve higher average log-likelihood
  on the initial uncorrupted test set at times.
