title: Label-wise Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification
abstract: We present a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in classification
  tasks based on label-wise decomposition of uncertainty measures. This label-wise
  perspective allows uncertainty to be quantified at the individual class level, thereby
  improving cost-sensitive decision-making and helping understand the sources of uncertainty.
  Furthermore, it allows to define total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty on
  the basis of non-categorical measures such as variance, going beyond common entropy-based
  measures. In particular, variance-based measures address some of the limitations
  associated with established methods that have recently been discussed in the literature.
  We show that our proposed measures adhere to a number of desirable properties. Through
  empirical evaluation on a variety of benchmark data sets – including applications
  in the medical domain where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial – we
  establish the effectiveness of label-wise uncertainty quantification.
