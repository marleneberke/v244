title: Conditional Bayesian Quadrature
abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating conditional or parametric expectations
  in the setting where obtaining samples or evaluating integrands is costly. Through
  the framework of probabilistic numerical methods (such as Bayesian quadrature),
  our novel approach allows to  incorporates prior information about the integrands
  especially the prior smoothness knowledge about the integrands and the conditional
  expectation. As a result, our approach provides a way of quantifying uncertainty
  and leads to a fast convergence rate, which is confirmed both theoretically and
  empirically on challenging tasks in Bayesian sensitivity analysis, computational
  finance and decision making under uncertainty.
