title: Domain Adaptation with Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence
abstract: Domain adaptation aims to use training data from one or multiple source
  domains to learn a hypothesis that can be generalized to a different, but related,
  target domain. As such, having a reliable measure for evaluating the discrepancy
  of both marginal and conditional distributions is crucial. We introduce Cauchy-Schwarz
  (CS) divergence to the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The CS divergence
  offers a theoretically tighter generalization error bound than the popular Kullback-Leibler
  divergence. This holds for the general case of supervised learning, including multi-class
  classification and regression. Furthermore, we illustrate that the CS divergence
  enables a simple estimator on the discrepancy of both marginal and conditional distributions
  between source and target domains in the representation space, without requiring
  any distributional assumptions. We provide multiple examples to illustrate how the
  CS divergence can be conveniently used in both distance metric- or adversarial training-based
  UDA frameworks, resulting in compelling performance. The code of our paper is available
