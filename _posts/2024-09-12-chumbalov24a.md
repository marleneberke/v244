title: Fast Interactive Search under a Scale-Free Comparison Oracle
abstract: A comparison-based search algorithm lets a user find a target item $t$ in
  a database by answering queries of the form, “Which of items $i$ and $j$ is closer
  to $t$?” Instead of formulating an explicit query (such as one or several keywords),
  the user navigates towards the target via a sequence of such (typically noisy) queries.
  We propose a scale-free probabilistic oracle model called $\gamma$-CKL for such
  similarity triplets $(i,j;t)$, which generalizes the CKL triplet model proposed
  in the literature. The generalization affords independent control over the discriminating
  power of the oracle and the dimension of the feature space containing the items.
  We develop a search algorithm with provably exponential rate of convergence under
  the $\gamma$-CKL oracle, thanks to a backtracking strategy that deals with the unavoidable
  errors in updating the belief region around the target. We evaluate the performance
  of the algorithm both over the posited oracle and over several real-world triplet
  datasets. We also report on a comprehensive user study, where human subjects navigate
  a database of face portraits.
