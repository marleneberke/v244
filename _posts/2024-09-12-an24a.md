title: Convergence Behavior of an Adversarial Weak Supervision Method
abstract: 'Labeling data via rules-of-thumb and minimal label supervision is central
  to Weak Supervision, a paradigm subsuming subareas of machine learning such as crowdsourced
  learning and semi-supervised ensemble learning.  By using this labeled data to train
  modern machine learning methods, the cost of acquiring large amounts of hand labeled
  data can be ameliorated.  Approaches to combining the rules-of-thumb falls into
  two camps, reflecting different ideologies of statistical estimation.  The most
  common approach, exemplified by the Dawid-Skene model, is based on probabilistic
  modeling.  The other, developed in the work of Balsubramani-Freund and others, is
  adversarial and game-theoretic.  We provide a variety of statistical results for
  the adversarial approach under log-loss: we characterize the form of the solution,
  relate it to logistic regression, demonstrate consistency, and give rates of convergence.  On
  the other hand, we find that probabilistic approaches for the same model class can
  fail to be consistent.  Experimental results are provided to corroborate the theoretical
  results.'
