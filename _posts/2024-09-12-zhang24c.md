title: Learning Topological Representations with Bidirectional Graph Attention Network
  for Solving Job Shop Scheduling Problem
abstract: Existing learning-based methods for solving job shop scheduling problems
  (JSSP) usually use off-the-shelf GNN models tailored to undirected graphs and neglect
  the rich and meaningful topological structures of disjunctive graphs (DGs). This
  paper proposes the topology-aware bidirectional graph attention network (TBGAT),
  a novel GNN architecture based on the attention mechanism, to embed the DG for solving
  JSSP in a local search framework. Specifically, TBGAT embeds the DG from a forward
  and a backward view, respectively, where the messages are propagated by following
  the different topologies of the views and aggregated via graph attention. Then,
  we propose a novel operator based on the message-passing mechanism to calculate
  the forward and backward topological sorts of the DG, which are the features for
  characterizing the topological structures and exploited by our model. In addition,
  we theoretically and experimentally show that TBGAT has linear computational complexity
  to the number of jobs and machines, respectively, strengthening our methodâ€™s practical
  value. Besides, extensive experiments on five synthetic datasets and seven classic
  benchmarks show that TBGAT achieves new SOTA results by outperforming a wide range
  of neural methods by a large margin. All the code and data are publicly available
  online at https://github.com/zcaicaros/TBGAT.
