title: End-to-end Conditional Robust Optimization
abstract: The field of Contextual Optimization (CO) integrates machine learning and
  optimization to solve decision making problems under uncertainty. Recently, a risk
  sensitive variant of CO, known as Conditional Robust Optimization (CRO), combines
  uncertainty quantification with robust optimization in order to promote safety and
  reliability in high stake applications. Exploiting modern differentiable optimization
  methods, we propose a novel end-to-end approach to train a CRO model in a way that
  accounts for both the empirical risk of the prescribed decisions and the quality
  of conditional coverage of the contextual uncertainty set that supports them. While
  guarantees of success for the latter objective are impossible to obtain from the
  point of view of conformal prediction theory, high quality conditional coverage
  is achieved empirically by ingeniously employing a logistic regression differentiable
  layer within the calculation of coverage quality in our training loss.We show that
  the proposed training algorithms produce decisions that outperform the traditional
  estimate then optimize approaches.
