title: Pure Exploration in Asynchronous Federated Bandits
abstract: We study the federated pure exploration problem of multi-armed bandits and
  linear bandits, where $M$ agents cooperatively identify the best arm via communicating
  with the central server. To enhance the robustness against latency and unavailability
  of agents that are common in practice, we propose the first federated asynchronous
  multi-armed bandit and linear bandit algorithms for pure exploration with fixed
  confidence. Our theoretical analysis shows the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal
  sample complexities and efficient communication costs in a fully asynchronous environment.
  Moreover, experimental results based on synthetic and real-world data empirically
  elucidate the effectiveness and communication cost-efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
