title: Model-Free Robust Reinforcement Learning with Sample Complexity Analysis
abstract: Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL) aims to derive a
  policy optimizing the worst-case performance within a predefined uncertainty set.
  Despite extensive research, previous DR-RL algorithms have predominantly favored
  model-based approaches, with limited availability of model-free methods offering
  convergence guarantees or sample complexities. This paper proposes a model-free
  DR-RL algorithm leveraging the Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) technique to close
  such a gap. Our innovative approach integrates a threshold mechanism that ensures
  finite sample requirements for algorithmic implementation, a significant departure
  from previous model-free algorithms. We adapt our algorithm to accommodate uncertainty
  sets defined by total variation, Chi-square divergence, and KL divergence, and provide
  finite sample analyses under all three cases. Remarkably, our algorithms represent
  the first model-free DR-RL approach featuring finite sample complexity for total
  variation and Chi-square divergence uncertainty sets, while also offering an improved
  sample complexity and broader applicability compared to existing model-free DR-RL
  algorithms for the KL divergence model. The complexities of our method establish
  the tightest results for all three uncertainty models in model-free DR-RL, underscoring
  the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm, and highlighting its potential
  for practical applications.
