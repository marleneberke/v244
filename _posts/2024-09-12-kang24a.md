title: Low-rank Matrix Bandits with Heavy-tailed Rewards
abstract: In stochastic low-rank matrix bandit, the expected reward of an arm is equal
  to the inner product between its feature matrix and some unknown $d_1$ by $d_2$
  low-rank parameter matrix $\Theta^*$ with rank $r \ll d_1\wedge d_2$. While all
  prior studies assume the payoffs are mixed with sub-Gaussian noises, in this work
  we loosen this strict assumption and consider the new problem of low-rank matrix
  bandit with heavy-tailed rewards (LowHTR), where the rewards only have finite $(1+\delta)$
  moment for some $\delta \in (0,1]$. By utilizing the truncation on observed payoffs
  and the dynamic exploration, we propose a novel algorithm called LOTUS attaining
  the regret bound of order $\tilde O(d^\frac{3}{2}r^\frac{1}{2}T^\frac{1}{1+\delta}/\tilde{D}_{rr})$
  without knowing $T$, which matches the state-of-the-art regret bound under sub-Gaussian
  noisesÂ \citep{lu2021low,kang2022efficient} with $\delta = 1$. Moreover, we establish
  a lower bound of the order $\Omega(d^\frac{\delta}{1+\delta} r^\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}
  T^\frac{1}{1+\delta}) = \Omega(T^\frac{1}{1+\delta})$ for LowHTR, which indicates
  our LOTUS is nearly optimal in the order of $T$. In addition, we improve LOTUS so
  that it does not require knowledge of the rank $r$ with $\tilde O(dr^\frac{3}{2}T^\frac{1+\delta}{1+2\delta})$
  regret bound, and it is efficient under the high-dimensional scenario. We also conduct
  simulations to demonstrate the practical superiority of our algorithm.
