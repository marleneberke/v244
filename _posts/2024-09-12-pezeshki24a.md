title: Value-Based Abstraction Functions for Abstraction Sampling
abstract: Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for solving problems involving complex
  probability distributions. Despite their versatility, these methods often suffer
  from inefficiencies, especially when dealing with rare events. As such, importance
  sampling emerged as a prominent technique for alleviating these challenges. Recently,
  a new scheme called Abstraction Sampling was developed that incorporated stratification
  to importance sampling over graphical models. However, existing work only explored
  a limited set of abstraction functions that guide  stratification. This study introduces
  three new classes of abstraction functions combined with seven distinct partitioning
  schemes, resulting in twenty-one new abstraction functions, each motivated by theory
  and intuition from both search and sampling domains. An extensive empirical analysis
  on over 400 problems compares these new schemes highlighting several well-performing
  candidates.
