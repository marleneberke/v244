title: 'To smooth a cloud or to pin it down: Expressiveness guarantees and insights
  on score matching in denoising diffusion models'
abstract: Denoising diffusion models are a class of generative models that have recently
  achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. Gradual noise is added to
  the data using a diffusion process, which transforms the data distribution into
  a Gaussian. Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an
  approximation of the time reversal of this diffusion initialized by Gaussian samples.
  Recent research has explored the sampling error achieved by diffusion models under
  the assumption of an absolute error $\epsilon$ achieved via a neural approximation
  of the score. To the best of our knowledge, no work formally quantifies the error
  of such neural approximation to the score. In this paper, we close the gap and present
  quantitative error bounds for approximating the score of denoising diffusion models
  using neural networks leveraging ideas from stochastic control. Finally, through
  simulation, we explore some of the insights that arise from our results confirming
  that diffusion models based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process require fewer
  parameters to better approximate the score than those based on the FÃ¶lmer drift
  / Pinned Brownian Motion.
