title: Knowledge Intensive Learning of Credal Networks
abstract: Bayesian networks are a popular class of directed probabilistic graphical
  models that allow for closed-form learning of the local parameters if complete data
  are available. However, learning the parameters is challenging when the data are
  sparse, incomplete, and uncertain. In this work, we present an approach to this
  problem based on credal networks, a generalization of Bayesian networks based on
  set-valued local parameters. We derive an algorithm to learn such set-valued parameters
  from data using qualitative knowledge in the form of monotonic influence statements.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that using qualitative knowledge reduces uncertainty
  about the parameters without significant loss in accuracy.
