title: On Hardware-efficient Inference in Probabilistic Circuits
abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a promising avenue to perform embedded
  reasoning under uncertainty. They support efficient and exact computation of various
  probabilistic inference tasks by design. Hence, hardware-efficient computation of
  PCs is highly interesting for edge computing applications. As computations in PCs
  are based on arithmetic with probability values, they are typically performed in
  the log domain to avoid underflow. Unfortunately, performing the log operation on
  hardware is costly. Hence, prior work has focused on computations in the linear
  domain, resulting in high resolution and energy requirements. This work proposes
  the first dedicated approximate computing framework for PCs that allows for low-resolution
  logarithm computations. We leverage Addition As Int, resulting in linear PC computation
  with simple hardware elements. Further, we provide a theoretical approximation error
  analysis and present an error compensation mechanism. Empirically, our method obtains
  up to 357{\texttimes} and 649{\texttimes} energy reduction on custom hardware for
  evidence and MAP queries respectively with little or no computational error.
