title: Functional Wasserstein Variational Policy Optimization
abstract: Variational policy optimization has become increasingly attractive to the
  reinforcement learning community because of its strong capability in uncertainty
  modeling and environment generalization. However, almost all existing studies in
  this area rely on Kullback{â€“}Leibler (KL) divergence which is unfortunately ill-defined
  in several situations. In addition, the policy is parameterized and optimized in
  weight space, which may not only bring additional unnecessary bias but also make
  the policy learning harder due to the complicatedly dependent weight posterior.
  In the paper, we design a novel functional Wasserstein variational policy optimization
  (FWVPO) based on the Wasserstein distance between function distributions. Specifically,
  we firstly parameterize policy as a Bayesian neural network but from a function-space
  view rather than a weight-space view and then propose FWVPO to optimize and explore
  the functional policy posterior. We prove that our FWVPO is a valid variational
  Bayesian objective and also guarantees the monotonic expected reward improvement
  under certain conditions. Experimental results on multiple reinforcement learning
  tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithm in terms of both cumulative
  rewards and uncertainty modeling capability.
