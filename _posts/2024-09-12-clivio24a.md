title: Towards Representation Learning for Weighting Problems in Design-Based Causal
  Inference
abstract: Reweighting a distribution to minimize a distance to a target distribution
  is a powerful and flexible strategy for estimating a wide range of causal effects,
  but can be challenging in practice because optimal weights typically depend on knowledge
  of the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we focus on design-based
  weights, which do not incorporate outcome information; prominent examples include
  prospective cohort studies, survey weighting, and the weighting portion of augmented
  weighting estimators. In such applications, we explore the central role of representation
  learning in finding desirable weights in practice. Unlike the common approach of
  assuming a well-specified representation, we highlight the error due to the choice
  of a representation and outline a general framework for finding suitable representations
  that minimize this error. Building on recent work that combines balancing weights
  and neural networks, we propose an end-to-end estimation procedure that learns a
  flexible representation, while retaining promising theoretical properties. We show
  that this approach is competitive in a range of common causal inference tasks.
