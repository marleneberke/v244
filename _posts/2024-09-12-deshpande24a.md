title: Calibrated and Conformal Propensity Scores for Causal Effect Estimation
abstract: Propensity scores are commonly used to balance observed covariates while
  estimating treatment effects. We argue that the probabilistic output of a learned
  propensity score model should be calibrated, i.e. a predictive treatment probability
  of 90% should correspond to 90% of individuals being assigned the treatment group.
  We propose simple recalibration techniques to ensure this property. We prove that
  calibration is a necessary condition for unbiased treatment effect estimation when
  using popular inverse propensity weighted and doubly robust estimators. We derive
  error bounds on causal effect estimates that directly relate to the quality of uncertainties
  provided by the probabilistic propensity score model and show that calibration strictly
  improves this error bound while also avoiding extreme propensity weights. We demonstrate
  improved causal effect estimation with calibrated propensity scores in several tasks
  including high-dimensional image covariates and genome-wide association studies
  (GWASs). Calibrated propensity scores improve the speed of GWAS analysis by more
  than two-fold by enabling the use of simpler models that are faster to train.
