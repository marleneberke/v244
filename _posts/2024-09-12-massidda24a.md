title: Learning Causal Abstractions of Linear Structural Causal Models
abstract: The need for modelling causal knowledge at different levels of granularity
  arises in several settings. Causal Abstraction provides a framework for formalizing
  this problem by relating two Structural Causal Models at different levels of detail.
  Despite increasing interest in applying causal abstraction, e.g. in the interpretability
  of large machine learning models, the graphical and parametrical conditions under
  which a causal model can abstract another are not known. Furthermore, learning causal
  abstractions from data is still an open problem. In this work, we tackle both issues
  for linear causal models with linear abstraction functions. First, we characterize
  how the low-level coefficients and the abstraction function determine the high-level
  coefficients and how the high-level model constrains the causal ordering of low-level
  variables. Then, we apply our theoretical results to learn high-level and low-level
  causal models and their abstraction function from observational data. In particular,
  we introduce Abs-LiNGAM, a method that leverages the constraints induced by the
  learned high-level model and the abstraction function to speedup the recovery of
  the larger low-level model, under the assumption of non-Gaussian noise terms. In
  simulated settings, we show the effectiveness of learning causal abstractions from
  data and the potential of our method in improving scalability of causal discovery.
