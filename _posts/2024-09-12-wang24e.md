title: 'AutoDrop: Training Deep Learning Models with Automatic Learning Rate Drop'
abstract: 'Modern deep learning (DL) architectures are trained using variants of the
  SGD algorithm and typically rely on the user to manually drop the learning rate
  when the training curve saturates. In this paper, we develop an algorithm, that
  we call AutoDrop, that realizes the learning rate drop automatically and stems from
  the properties of the learning dynamics of DL systems. Specifically, it is motivated
  by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters, i.e., the
  velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed learning rate
  initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft saturation. At saturation,
  the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity saturation is a good indicator
  for dropping the learning rate. After the drop, the angular velocity {“}resets{”}
  and follows the pattern described above, increasing again until saturation. AutoDrop
  is built on this idea and drops the learning rate whenever the angular velocity
  saturates. The method is simple to implement, computationally cheap, and by design
  avoids the short-horizon bias problem. We show that AutoDrop achieves favorable
  performance compared to many different baseline manual and automatic learning rate
  schedulers, and matches the SOTA performance on all our experiments. On the theoretical
  front, we claim two contributions: we formulate the learning rate behavior based
  on the angular velocity and provide general convergence theory for the learning
  rate schedulers that decrease the learning rate step-wise, rather than continuously
  as is commonly analyzed.'
