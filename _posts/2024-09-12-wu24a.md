title: Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning
abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) is an emerging field that combines the strong
  function approximation power of deep learning with the uncertainty modeling capabilities
  of Bayesian methods. In addition to those virtues, however, there are accompanying
  issues brought by such a combination to the classical parameter-space variational
  inference, such as the nonmeaningful priors, intricate posteriors, and possible
  pathologies. In this paper, we propose a new function-space variational inference
  solution called Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference (FWBI), which can assign
  meaningful functional priors and obtain well-behaved posterior. Specifically, we
  develop a Wasserstein distance-based bridge to avoid the potential pathological
  behaviors of Kullback{â€“}Leibler (KL) divergence between stochastic processes that
  arise in most existing functional variational inference approaches. The derived
  functional variational objective is well-defined and proved to be a lower bound
  of the model evidence. We demonstrate the improved predictive performance and better
  uncertainty quantification of our FWBI on several tasks compared with various parameter-space
  and function-space variational methods.
