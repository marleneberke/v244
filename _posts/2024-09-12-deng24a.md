title: On Convergence of Federated Averaging Langevin Dynamics
abstract: We propose a federated averaging Langevin algorithm (FA-LD) for uncertainty
  quantification and mean predictions  with distributed clients. In particular, we
  generalize beyond normal posterior distributions and consider a general class of
  models. We develop theoretical guarantees for FA-LD for strongly log-concave distributions
  with non-i.i.d data and study how the injected noise and the stochastic-gradient
  noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning rates affect the convergence.
  Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal choice of local updates to minimize
  the communication cost. Important to our approach is that the communication efficiency
  does not deteriorate with the injected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition,
  we examine in our FA-LD algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over
  different clients. We observe that there is a trade-off between the pairs among
  communication, accuracy, and data privacy. As local devices may become inactive
  in federated networks, we also show convergence results based on different averaging
  schemes where only partial device updates are available. In such a case, we discover
  an additional bias that does not decay to zero.
