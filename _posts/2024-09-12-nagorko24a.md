title: General Markov Model for Solving Patrolling Games
abstract: 'Safeguarding critical infrastructure has recently emerged as a global challenge.
  To address complex security concerns raised by broadening array of threats, effective
  mobile security forces are essential. A key aspect involves designing optimal patrolling
  strategies for mobile units. Two bodies of research dealt with this: stochastic
  patrolling and partially observable stochastic games. Alas, the first approach makes
  too-far-reaching simplifying assumption and the second one is more expressive but
  computationally challenging. The model proposed in this paper is inspired by partially
  observable stochastic games so that it is general enough to enable comprehensive
  modeling of attacker-defender interactions but a the same time remains computationally
  friendly. With our proposed robust SHIELD algorithm, we are able to find a defense
  strategy where the probability of apprehending the attacker can be nearly doubled
  compared to the state of the art.'
