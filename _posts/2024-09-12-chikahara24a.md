title: Differentiable Pareto-Smoothed Weighting for High-Dimensional Heterogeneous
  Treatment Effect Estimation
abstract: There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
  across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high
  performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is
  challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample
  selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To
  avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate
  feature representations using inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, due
  to their numerically unstable IPW weights, these methods suffer from estimation
  bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator by weighted
  representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework
  that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Our experimental results
  show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our proposed method outperforms
  the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes. Our code is available
  at [this https URL](https://github.com/ychika/DPSW).
