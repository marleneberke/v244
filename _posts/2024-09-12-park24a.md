title: Quantifying Representation Reliability in Self-Supervised Learning Models
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning models extract general-purpose representations
  from data. Quantifying the reliability of these representations is crucial, as many
  downstream models rely on them as input for their own tasks. To this end, we introduce
  a formal definition of _representation reliability_: the representation for a given
  test point is considered to be reliable if the downstream models built on top of
  that representation can consistently generate accurate predictions for that test
  point. However, accessing downstream data to quantify the representation reliability
  is often infeasible or restricted due to privacy concerns. We propose an ensemble-based
  method for estimating the representation reliability without knowing the downstream
  tasks a priori. Our method is based on the concept of _neighborhood consistency_
  across distinct pre-trained representation spaces. The key insight is to find shared
  neighboring points as anchors to align these representation spaces before comparing
  them. We demonstrate through comprehensive numerical experiments that our method
  effectively captures the representation reliability with a high degree of correlation,
  achieving robust and favorable performance compared with baseline methods.'
