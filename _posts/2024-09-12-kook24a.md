title: How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional
  Regression
abstract: Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression,
  are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of
  deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression
  models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this
  gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations
  (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We
  empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve
  as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications
  involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that
  models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods
  in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty
  quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible
  neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.
