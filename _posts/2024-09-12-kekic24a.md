title: Targeted Reduction of Causal Models
abstract: Why does a phenomenon occur? Addressing this question is central to most
  scientific inquiries and often relies on simulations of scientific models.  As models
  become more intricate, deciphering the causes behind phenomena in high-dimensional
  spaces of interconnected variables becomes increasingly challenging. Causal Representation
  Learning (CRL) offers a promising avenue to uncover interpretable causal patterns
  within these simulations through an interventional lens. However, developing general
  CRL frameworks suitable for practical applications remains an open challenge. We
  introduce _Targeted Causal Reduction_ (TCR), a method for condensing complex intervenable
  models into a concise set of causal factors that explain a specific target phenomenon.
  We propose an information theoretic objective to learn TCR from interventional data
  of simulations, establish identifiability for continuous variables under shift interventions
  and present a practical algorithm for learning TCRs. Its ability to generate interpretable
  high-level explanations from complex models is demonstrated on toy and mechanical
  systems, illustrating its potential to assist scientists in the study of complex
  phenomena in a broad range of disciplines.
