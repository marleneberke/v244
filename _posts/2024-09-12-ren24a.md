title: Decision-Focused Evaluation of Worst-Case Distribution Shift
abstract: Recent studies have shown that performance on downstream optimization tasks
  often diverges from standard accuracy-based losses, highlighting that the loss function
  of a predictive model should align with the decision task of the downstream optimizer.
  Despite this observation, no work{—} to our knowledge{—}has yet examined the impact
  of this divergence for distribution shift. In this paper, we demonstrate that worst-case
  distribution shifts identified by traditional average accuracy-based metrics fundamentally
  differ from those for the downstream decision task at hand. We introduce a novel
  framework that employs a hierarchical model structure to identify worst-case distribution
  shifts in predictive resource allocation settings. This task is more difficult than
  in standard distribution shift settings because of combinatorial interactions, where
  decisions depend on the joint presence of individuals in the allocation task. We
  show that the problem can be reformulated as a submodular optimization problem,
  enabling efficient approximations, to capture shifts both within and across instances
  of the optimization problem.
