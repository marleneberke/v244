title: 'MetaCOG: A Heirarchical Probabilistic Model for Learning Meta-Cognitive Visual
  Representations'
abstract: 'Humans have the capacity to question what we see and to recognize when
  our vision is unreliable (e.g., when we realize that we are experiencing a visual
  illusion). Inspired by this capacity, we present MetaCOG: a hierarchical probabilistic
  model that can be attached to a neural object detector to monitor its outputs and
  determine their reliability. MetaCOG achieves this by learning a probabilistic model
  of the object detector’s performance via Bayesian inference{—}i.e., a meta-cognitive
  representation of the network’s propensity to hallucinate or miss different object
  categories. Given a set of video frames processed by an object detector, MetaCOG
  performs joint inference over the underlying 3D scene and the detector’s performance,
  grounding inference on a basic assumption of object permanence. Paired with three
  neural object detectors, we show that MetaCOG accurately recovers each detector’s
  performance parameters and improves the overall system’s accuracy. We additionally
  show that MetaCOG is robust to varying levels of error in object detector outputs,
  showing proof-of-concept for a novel approach to the problem of detecting and correcting
  errors in vision systems when ground-truth is not available.'
