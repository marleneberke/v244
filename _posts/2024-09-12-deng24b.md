title: Reflected Schrödinger Bridge for Constrained Generative Modeling
abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for large-scale generative
  models in real-world applications. These applications often involve data distributions
  confined within bounded domains, typically requiring ad-hoc thresholding techniques
  for boundary enforcement. Reflected diffusion models aim to enhance generalizability
  by generating the data distribution through a backward process governed by reflected
  Brownian motion. However, reflected diffusion models may not easily adapt to diverse
  domains without the derivation of proper diffeomorphic mappings and do not guarantee
  optimal transport properties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Reflected
  Schrödinger Bridge algorithm{—}an entropy-regularized optimal transport approach
  tailored for generating data within diverse bounded domains. We derive elegant reflected
  forward-backward stochastic differential equations with Neumann and Robin boundary
  conditions, extend divergence-based likelihood training to bounded domains, and
  explore natural connections to entropic optimal transport for the study of approximate
  linear convergence{—}a valuable insight for practical training. Our algorithm yields
  robust generative modeling in diverse domains, and its scalability is demonstrated
  in real-world constrained generative modeling through standard image benchmarks.
