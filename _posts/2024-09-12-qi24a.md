title: Graph Feedback Bandits with Similar Arms
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with
  graph feedback. Motivated by the clinical trials and recommendation problem, we
  assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are  similar (i.e., their
  means are close enough). We establish a regret lower bound for this novel feedback
  structure and introduce two UCB-based algorithms: D-UCB with problem-independent
  regret upper bounds and C-UCB with problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the
  similarity structure, we also consider the scenario  where the number of arms increases
  over time. Practical applications related to this scenario include Q&A platforms
  (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews in Amazon and Flipkart.  Answers
  (product reviews) continually appear on the website, and the goal is to display
  the best answers (product reviews) at the top. When the means of arms are independently
  generated from some distribution, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms  and
  discuss the sub-linearity of bounds in relation to the distribution of means. Finally,
  we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.'
