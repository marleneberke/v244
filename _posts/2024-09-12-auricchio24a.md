title: On the Capacitated Facility Location Problem with Scarce Resources
abstract: This paper investigates the Mechanism Design aspects of the $m$-Capacitated
  Facility Location Problem where the total facility capacity is lower than the number
  of agents. Following  \cite{aziz2020capacity}, the Social Welfare of the facility
  location is determined through a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) game where agents
  compete after the facility positions are established. When the number of facilities
  is $m>1$, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the FCFS game is not unique, thus the utility
  of the agents and the notion of truthfulness are not well-defined. To address these
  issues, we consider absolutely truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms able to prevent
  agents from misreporting regardless of the strategies played during the FCFS game.
  We pair this more stringent truthfulness requirement with the notion of Equilibrium
  Stable (ES) mechanism, i.e. mechanisms whose Social Welfare does not depend on the
  NE of the FCFS game. We show that the class of percentile mechanisms is absolutely
  truthful and characterize under which conditions they are ES. We then show that
  the approximation ratio of each ES percentile mechanism is bounded and determine
  its value. Notably, when all the facilities have the same capacity and the number
  of agents is large enough, it is possible to achieve an approximation ratio smaller
  than $1+\frac{1}{2m-1}$. We enhance our findings by empirically evaluating the mechanisms’
  performances when agents’ true positions follows a distribution.
