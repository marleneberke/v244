title: Fast Reliability Estimation for Neural Networks with Adversarial Attack-Driven
  Importance Sampling
abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the reliability of Neural
  Networks (NNs) by integrating adversarial attacks with Importance Sampling (IS),
  enhancing the assessment’s precision and efficiency. Leveraging adversarial attacks
  to guide IS, our method efficiently identifies vulnerable input regions, offering
  a more directed alternative to traditional Monte Carlo methods. While comparing
  our approach with classical reliability techniques like FORM and SORM, and with
  classical rare event simulation methods such as Cross-Entropy IS, we acknowledge
  its reliance on the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and its inability to handle
  very high-dimensional data such as ImageNet. Despite these challenges, our comprehensive
  empirical validations on the datasets the MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the method’s
  capability to accurately estimate NN reliability for a variety of models. Our research
  not only presents an innovative strategy for reliability assessment in NNs but also
  sets the stage for further work exploiting the connection between adversarial robustness
  and the field of statistical reliability engineering.
