title: Inference for Optimal Linear Treatment Regimes in Personalized Decision-making
abstract: Personalized decision-making, tailored to individual characteristics, is
  gaining significant attention. The optimal treatment regime aims to provide the
  best-expected outcome in the entire population, known as the value function. One
  approach to determine this optimal regime is by maximizing the Augmented Inverse
  Probability Weighting (AIPW) estimator of the value function.  However, the derived
  treatment regime can be intricate and nonlinear, limiting their use. For clarity
  and interoperability, we emphasize linear regimes and determine the optimal linear
  regime by optimizing the AIPW estimator within set constraints.  While the AIPW
  estimator offers a viable path to estimating the optimal regime, current methodologies
  predominantly focus on its asymptotic distribution, leaving a gap in studying the
  linear regime itself. However, there are many benefits to understanding the regime,
  as pinpointing significant covariates can enhance treatment effects and provide
  future clinical guidance. In this paper, we explore the asymptotic distribution
  of the estimated linear regime. Our results show that the parameter associated with
  the linear regime follows a cube-root convergence to a non-normal limiting distribution
  characterized by the maximizer of a centered Gaussian process with a quadratic drift.
  When making inferences for the estimated linear regimes with cube-root convergence
  in practical scenarios, the standard nonparametric bootstrap is invalid. As a solution,
  we facilitate the Cattaneo et al. (2020) bootstrap technique to provide a consistent
  distributional approximation for the estimated linear regimes, validated further
  through simulations and real-world data applications from the eICU Collaborative
  Research Database.
