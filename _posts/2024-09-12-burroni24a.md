title: Sample Average Approximation for Black-Box Variational Inference
abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) is a general-purpose approximate
  inference approach that converts inference to a stochastic optimization problem.
  However, the difficulty of solving the BBVI optimization problem reliably and robustly
  using stochastic gradient methods has limited its applicability.  We present a novel
  optimization approach for BBVI using the sample average approximation (SAA).  SAA
  converts stochastic problems to deterministic ones by optimizing over a fixed random
  sample, which enables optimization tools such as quasi-Newton methods and line search
  that bypass the difficulties faced by stochastic gradient methods. We design an
  approach called "SAA for VI" that solves a sequence of SAA problems with increasing
  sample sizes to reliably and robustly solve BBVI problems without problem-specific
  tuning.  We focus on quasi-Newton methods, which are well suited to problems with
  up to hundreds of latent variables. Our experiments show that SAA for VI simplifies
  the VI problem and achieves faster performance than existing methods.
