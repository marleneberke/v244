title: 'Hybrid CtrlFormer: Learning Adaptive Search Space Partition for Hybrid Action
  Control via Transformer-based Monte Carlo Tree Search'
abstract: 'Hybrid action control tasks are common in the real world, which require
  controlling some discrete and continuous actions simultaneously. To solve these
  tasks, existing Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) methods either directly build
  a separate policy for each type of action or simplify the hybrid action space into
  a discrete or continuous action control problem. However, these methods neglect
  the challenge of exploration resulting from the complexity of the hybrid action
  space. Thus, it is necessary to design more sample efficient algorithms. To this
  end, we propose a novel Hybrid Control Transformer (Hybrid CtrlFormer), to achieve
  better exploration and exploitation for the hybrid action control problems. The
  core idea is: 1) we construct a hybrid action space tree with the discrete actions
  at the higher level and the continuous parameter space at the lower level. Each
  parameter space is split into multiple subregions. 2) To simplify the exploration
  space, a Transformer-based Monte-Carlo tree search method is designed to efficiently
  evaluate and partition the hybrid action space into good and bad subregions along
  the tree. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and sample efficiency
  in a variety of environments with discrete-continuous action space.'
