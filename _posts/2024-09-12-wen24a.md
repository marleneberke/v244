title: 'GCVR: Reconstruction from Cross-View Enable Sufficient and Robust Graph Contrastive
  Learning'
abstract: Among the existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for graphs, graph
  contrastive learning (GCL) frameworks usually automatically generate supervision
  by transforming the same graph into different views through graph augmentation operations.  The
  computation-efficient augmentation techniques enable the prevalent usage of GCL
  to alleviate the supervision shortage issue.   Despite the remarkable performance
  of those GCL methods, the InfoMax principle used to guide the optimization of GCL
  has been proven to be insufficient to avoid redundant information without losing
  important features.   In light of this, we introduce the Graph Contrastive Learning
  with Cross-View Reconstruction (GCVR), aiming to learn robust and sufficient representation
  from graph data. Specifically, GCVR introduces a cross-view reconstruction mechanism
  based on conventional graph contrastive learning to elicit those essential features
  from raw graphs. Besides, we introduce an extra adversarial view perturbed from
  the original view in the contrastive loss to pursue the intactness of the graph
  semantics and strengthen the representation robustness. We empirically demonstrate
  that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on graph classification
  tasks over multiple benchmark datasets.
