title: 'Causal Discovery with Deductive Reasoning: One Less Problem'
abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms aim to extract causal relationships
  between variables of interest by using conditional independence tests (CITs). However,
  CITs with large conditioning sets often lead to unreliable results due to their
  low statistical power, propagating errors throughout the course of causal discovery.
  As the reliability of CITs is crucial for their practical applicability, recent
  approaches rely on either tricky heuristics or complicated routines with high computational
  costs to tackle inconsistent test results. Against this background, we propose a
  principled, simple, yet effective method, coined \textsc{deduce-dep}, which corrects
  unreliable conditional independence statements by replacing them with deductively
  reasoned results from lower-order CITs. An appealing property of \textsc{deduce-dep}
  is that it can be seamlessly plugged into existing constraint-based methods and
  serves as a modular subroutine. In particular, we showcase the integration of \textsc{deduce-dep}
  into representative algorithms such as HITON-PC and PC, illustrating its practicality.
  Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method properly corrects unreliable CITs,
  leading to improved performance in causal structure learning.
