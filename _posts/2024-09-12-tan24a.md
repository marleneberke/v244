title: A Homogenization Approach for Gradient-Dominated Stochastic Optimization
abstract: Gradient dominance property is a condition weaker than strong convexity,
  yet sufficiently ensures global convergence even in non-convex optimization. This
  property finds wide applications in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL),
  and operations management. In this paper, we propose the stochastic homogeneous
  second-order descent method (SHSODM) for stochastic functions enjoying gradient
  dominance property based on a recently proposed homogenization approach. Theoretically,
  we provide its sample complexity analysis, and further present an enhanced result
  by incorporating variance reduction techniques. Our findings show that SHSODM matches
  the best-known sample complexity achieved by other second-order methods for gradient-dominated
  stochastic optimization but without cubic regularization. Empirically, since the
  homogenization approach only relies on solving extremal eigenvector problem at each
  iteration instead of Newton-type system, our methods gain the advantage of cheaper
  computational cost and robustness in ill-conditioned problems. Numerical experiments
  on several RL tasks demonstrate the better performance of SHSODM compared to other
  off-the-shelf methods.
