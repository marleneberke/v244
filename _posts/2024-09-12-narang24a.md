title: Efficient Interactive Maximization of BP and Weakly Submodular Objectives
abstract: 'In the context of online interactive machine learning with combinatorial
  objectives, we extend purely submodular prior work to more general non-submodular
  objectives.  This includes: (1) those that are additively decomposable into a sum
  of two terms (a monotone submodular and monotone supermodular term, known as a BP
  decomposition); and (2) those that are only weakly submodular.  In both cases, this
  allows representing not only competitive (submodular) but also complementary (supermodular)
  relationships between objects, enhancing this setting to a broader range of applications
  (e.g., movie recommendations, medical treatments, etc.) where this is beneficial.  In
  the two-term case, moreover, we study not only the more typical monolithic feedback
  approach but also a novel framework where feedback is available separately for each
  term.  With real-world practicality and scalability in mind, we integrate \Nystrom{}
  sketching techniques to significantly improve the computational complexity, including
  for the purely submodular case. In the Gaussian process contextual bandits setting,
  we show sub-linear theoretical regret bounds in all cases. We also empirically show
  good applicability to recommendation systems and data subset selection.'
