title: Cooperative Meta-Learning with Gradient Augmentation
abstract: 'Model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most widely used gradient-based
  meta-learning, consisting of two optimization loops: an inner loop and outer loop.
  MAML learns the new task from meta-initialization parameters with an inner update
  and finds the meta-initialization parameters in the outer loop. In general, the
  injection of noise into the gradient of the model for augmenting the gradient is
  one of the widely used regularization methods. In this work, we propose a novel
  cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization
  with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model
  for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner
  which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding
  better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the
  inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers
  with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate
  that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads
  to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and
  few-shot node classification tasks. Our codes are at https://github.com/JJongyn/CML.'
