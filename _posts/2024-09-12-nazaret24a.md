title: Extremely Greedy Equivalence Search
abstract: The goal of causal discovery is to learn a directed acyclic graph from data.  One
  of the most well-known methods for this problem is Greedy Equivalence Search (GES).  GES
  searches for the graph by incrementally and greedily adding or removing edges to
  maximize a model selection criterion.  It has strong theoretical guarantees on infinite
  data but can fail in practice on finite data.  In this paper, we first identify
  some of the causes of GESâ€™s failure, finding that it  can get blocked in local optima,
  especially in denser graphs.  We then propose eXtremely Greedy Equivalent Search
  (XGES), which involves a new heuristic to improve the search strategy of GES while
  retaining its theoretical guarantees.  In particular, XGES favors deleting edges
  early in the search over inserting edges, which reduces the possibility of the search
  ending in local optima.  A further contribution of this work is an efficient algorithmic
  formulation of XGES (and GES).  We benchmark XGES on simulated datasets with known
  ground truth.  We find that XGES consistently outperforms GES in recovering the
  correct graphs, and  it is 10 times faster.
